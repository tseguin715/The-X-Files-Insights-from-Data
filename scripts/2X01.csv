BOY ON MESSAGE,Hello from the children of planet Earth.,7
MULDER,"Thirteen years after its launch, Voyager One passed the orbital plane of Neptune and essentially leaving our solar system. Within that time, there were no further messages sent. Nor are any planned. We wanted to listen. On October 12th, 1992, NASA initiated the high-resolution microwave survey.",46

Less than one year later, first-term Nevada Senator Richard Bryan successfully championed an amendment which terminated the project. Observatory; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; Control Room."") I wanted to believe but the tools have been taken away. The X-Files have been shut down. They closed our eyes.

MAN #1,Very hot.,2

MAN #1,"By the end of the song, I had like forty dollars laid out on the rail.",16
MAN #2,"It’s not a long song, is it?",7
SCULLY,It is advantageous to begin an autopsy with removal of the cranium. The cranium is opened with a horizontal division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.,26
FEMALE STUDENT,Something wrong?,2
SCULLY,"What this man imagined... his dreams, who he loved, saw, heard, remembered... what he feared... somehow it’s... all locked inside this small mass of tissue and fluid.",27
FEMALE STUDENT,"Are you okay, Agent Scully? You kind of sounded a... little spooky.",12
SCULLY,"Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.",4
MULDER,Four dollars for the first hour of parking is criminal. What you got better be worth at least forty-five minutes.,20
SCULLY,"You know, Mulder, from... from back there, you look like him.",11
MULDER,Him?,1
SCULLY,Deep Throat.,2
MULDER,"He’s dead, Scully. I attended his funeral at Arlington through eight-power binoculars from a thousand yards away. Now, the picture frame was turned down, you wanted to talk. What have you found?",32
SCULLY,I wanted to talk but I haven’t found anything.,9
MULDER,"It’s dangerous for us just to have a little chat, Scully. We must assume we’re being watched.",17
SCULLY,"Mulder, I haven’t seen any indication...",6
MULDER,"No, no, of course not. These people are the best.",10
SCULLY,"I’ve taken all of the necessary precautions. I have doubled back over my tracks to make sure that I haven’t been followed and no one has ever followed me. The X-Files have been terminated, Mulder. We have been reassigned. I mean, what makes you think they care about us anymore anyway?",51
MULDER,So why have you bothered to come here covertly?,9
SCULLY,Because I realized that it was the only way that you would see me.,14
MULDER,So what do you want?,5
SCULLY,"To know that you’re all right. Mulder, you passed me today within a foot, but you were miles away.",19
MULDER,"They’ve got me on electronic surveillance. White-bread cases, bank fraud, insurance fraud, health care swindles.",15
SCULLY,"Mulder, I know that you feel... frustrated that without the bureau’s resources, it’s impossible for you to continue...",18
MULDER,"No, it...",2
SCULLY,"Well, what then? When the bureau first shut us down, you said that you would go on for as long as the truth was out there. But I no longer feel that from you.",34
MULDER,Have you ever been to San Diego?,7
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,Did you check out the Palomar observatory?,7
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,"From 1948 until recently, it was the largest telescope in the world. The idea and design came from a brilliant and wealthy astronomer named George Ellery Hale. Actually, the idea was presented to Hale one night. While he was playing billiards, an elf climbed in his window and told him to get money from the Rockefeller Foundation for a telescope.",60
SCULLY,"And you’re worried that all your life, you’ve been seeing elves?",11
MULDER,In my case... little green men.,6
SCULLY,"But, Mulder... during your time with the X-Files, you’ve seen so much.",12
MULDER,"That’s just the point. Seeing is not enough, I should have something to hold onto. Some solid evidence. I learned that from you.",23
SCULLY,"Your sister’s abduction, you’ve held onto that.",7
MULDER,I’m beginning to wonder if... if that ever even happened.,10
SCULLY,"Mulder, even if George Hale only saw elves in his mind, the telescope still got built. Don’t give up. And next time... We meet out in the open.",28

MULDER,"It’s Bach. ""Brandenburg Concerto Number Three.""",6
RICHARD MATHESON,Two.,1
MULDER,Good thing it wasn’t a Double Jeopardy question.,8
RICHARD MATHESON,Do you know the significance of this piece?,8
MULDER,"Well, uh... recalling music appreciation with Professor Ganz, Bach had a genius for polyphonic...",14
RICHARD MATHESON,"This is the first selection of music on the Voyager spacecraft. The first. Four and a half billion years from now, when the sun exhausts its fuel and swells to engulf the earth, this expression will still be out there, traveling four and a half billion years. That is, if it’s not intercepted first. Imagine, Fox. If another civilization out there were to hear this, they would think ""what a wonderful place the earth must be."" I would want this to be the first contact with another lifeform.",88
MULDER,"I know I’ve let you down. You’ve supported me at great risk to your reputation. I realized when they shut us down, there was nothing you could do. All I can say is, I think we were close. To what, I don’t know. What?",44
RICHARD MATHESON,"Do you like Bach, Mulder?",5
MULDER,I live for Bach.,4
RICHARD MATHESON,Then let’s hear it again. I take it you’re familiar with the high-resolution microwave survey?,15
MULDER,The search for extraterrestrial radio signals. They shut it down.,10
RICHARD MATHESON,"You have to get to the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. I’ll try to delay them as long as I can but my guess is you’ll have at least twenty-four hours. After that, I can no longer hold off the Blue Beret U.F.O. Retrieval Team. And they have been authorized to display terminal force.",55

SCULLY ON TAPE,No. Is he in some kind of trouble?,8
SKINNER ON TAPE,"Agent Mulder failed to appear at his assignment this morning. His, uh... his whereabouts are unknown.",16
SCULLY ON TAPE,"Sir, I’ll volunteer my time to assist in any search.",10
SKINNER ON TAPE,"No, Agent Scully, the bureau can handle...",7
SKINNER,She doesn’t know where he is.,6
CSM,How can you be so sure?,6
SKINNER,"Because if she knew, she wouldn’t be so worried about him. I don’t smoke.",14
CSM,She’ll find him.,3
MULDER,Gracias.,1
MAN,De nada.,2
MULDER,"No trace evidence immediately apparent around the exterior of the control room which is locked with chains. The power has been turned off. Although, the control panel lights are still on. The room is about thirty by fifteen. I see no signs of any recent occupation. There’s quite an odor of mildew in the air... the air is stale. If anyone’s been here recently... I see no indications.",68

SCULLY,"""Galactic latitude?""",2
MORRIS,"May I ask what you’re doing here, Agent Scully?",9
SCULLY,Are you following me?,4
MORRIS,Agent Mulder’s residence is under surveillance. Please explain why you’re here.,11
SCULLY,I was told by the Assistant Director that Mulder was gone.,11
MORRIS,So?,1
SCULLY,"So, whenever he’s away, I feed his fish.",8
MAN,What the hell is this?,5
MORRIS,Looks like a self-test the computer does.,7

They’re still out in the woods!"")",72
MULDER,"Jorge, no comprende! Did you say men? Hombres?",8
TROISKY,"Looks like the ""wow"" signal.",5
SCULLY,"The ""wow"" signal?",3
TROISKY,"Ohio State has a radio telescope that conducts electronic searches for extraterrestrial intelligence. In August 1977, my buddy, Jerry Ehman, found a transmission on the print-out like this. He was so excited, he wrote ""wow"" in the margins.",38
SCULLY,What was there?,3
TROISKY,A signal thirty times stronger than galactic background noise. It came through on the twenty-one centimeter frequency which no satellite transmitters are allowed to use.,25
TROISKY,"The signal was intermittent... like morse code. And more importantly, the signal seemed to turn itself on while in the telescope’s beam. The ""Wow"" signal is the best evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. But this... this is better. Where did you get this?",42
SCULLY,Maybe you can tell me. Is that from Ohio State?,10
TROISKY,Can’t tell. There are a few nickel-and-dime S.E.T.I. projects around. U.C. Berkeley has one. The Planetary Society has one in Harvard and in Argentina.,24

MULDER,"The day is... the time is 10:30. Although not a qualified pathologist, I will record my observations of the body in case at some future time, decomposition should obscure forensic evidence. The subject, perhaps victim... is hispanic male, undetermined age. There are no overt external injuries apparent. There are no indications of any lightning strikes. No singeing of the air or burns of any kind. There are no... there are no puncture wounds due to needles or probes commonly associated with cases of alien abduction. The subject was discovered in sitting position. Riger mortis having set in, a little less than half an hour had elapsed. The skin is strikingly affected by goose flesh. The body shows signs of intense cadaveric spasm. The expression reflects... My God, Scully. It’s as if he’s been frightened to death. Again, Scully, nothing but evidence... and again, no evidence at all. The print-outs received in the transmission indicate contact with another lifeform and yet I cannot see them. Even if I could see them, would they really be there? How do I know this isn’t some classified military satellite? These transmissions are from the Voyager, for God’s sake. Could extraterrestrials really have intercepted them? Or is this just some elaborate joke played on those who want to believe? I was sent here by one of those people. Deep Throat said ""Trust no one."" And that’s hard, Scully... suspecting everyone, everything. It wears you down. You even begin to doubt what you know is the truth. Before, I could only trust myself. Now, I can only trust you... and they’ve taken you away from me. My life up to this point has been about the need to see her again. To see them.

SKINNER,But?,1
MULDER,"But I had enough on that surveillance to arrest those suspects. After three days, I could have nailed them on forty counts of bank fraud but you left me there. I’m surprised you even noticed I was gone, let alone wiretap my phone... an illegal procedure without a court order.",50
