FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE,"Welcome home, Mr. Kline.",4
WIN SHROEDER,"Oops. Did you get some on you, Dave?",8
DAVE KLINE,Shroeder's out there painting our mailbox! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to paint the whole damn house pink.,22
NANCY KLINE,Dave.,1
DAVE KLINE,"Forget about the mailbox, huh? I'm going to make this whole damn place look like you won it selling cosmetics. How about that? That'll show these Nazis.",27
NANCY KLINE,"Honey, would you just calm down. Rules are rules.",9
DAVE KLINE,"They're repainting our mailbox because it's ""Desert Sienna"" instead of ""Desert Sage."" I mean, this guy is a freakin' weirdo.",20
NANCY KLINE,Hon... what's that package?,4
DAVE KLINE,I don't know. It doesn't say who sent it.,9
NANCY KLINE,Whoa.,1
DAVE KLINE,Tasteful.,1
NANCY KLINE,"Boy, the neighbors would really hate that.",7
NANCY KLINE,Honey... What is it?,4
DAVE KLINE,Stay here.,2
NANCY KLINE,Dave? Honey?!,2
MULDER,"Wow. Take a look at this. Honey, what do you think? Is this place",14

MULDER,"I'm Rob...... and this is my lovely wife, Laura.",9
PAT VERLANDER,Rob and Laura Petrie.,4
SCULLY,"We pronounce it ""Pee-trie,"" actually.",5
PAT VERLANDER,Oh.,1
MULDER,Like the dish.,3
PAT VERLANDER,"Well, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Pat Verlander. I live six doors down. I'm the neighborhood welcome wagon.",20
SCULLY,"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Pat.",6
PAT VERLANDER,"I really must say,",4
SCULLY,I'm sorry?,2
PAT VERLANDER,The 6:00 cutoff? All move-ins are required to be completed It's one of our rules.,15
MULDER,Wow. The photos did not do it justice.,8
PAT VERLANDER,"Guys, fast, fast now. Come on.",6
MULDER,The previous owners left it so clean.,7
PAT VERLANDER,"What do you do for a living Mr... Petrie? That's right, isn't it?",13
MULDER,"Yeah, I, uh... I work mostly at home which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself.",20
PAT VERLANDER,Oh.,1
SCULLY,"This place really is immaculate, Pat. I, uh, I wouldn't mind sending a thank-you note to the previous owners.",19
PAT VERLANDER,Th-that's sweet. Um... Good.,4
MAN,Hurry up! Come on... Come on...,6
MAN,"Okay, move it, people. Come on.",6
WIN SHROEDER,Rob and Laura Petrie.,4
MULDER,Yep.,1
SCULLY,"""Pee-trie.""",1
WIN SHROEDER,"Win Shroeder, next-door neighbor. Welcome home.",6
MULDER,"Hi, Win. Nice to meet you.",6
WIN SHROEDER,"Now, don't you folks worry. We'll have you moved in before",11
GORDY,5:19.,1
WIN SHROEDER,"Uh... pardon me, neighbor.",4
MULDER,"Thank you. Thanks. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.",11
SCULLY,Excuse me! I'll get that. It's okay.,7
BIG MIKE,"No. No, don't be silly. It's heavy. I got it.",10
BIG MIKE,"Oh, no. I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.",9
CAMI SHROEDER,"Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike, it's okay. It's okay, Mike. Go help Gordy.",12
BIG MIKE,Send me any bills. I'm... I'm sorry.,7
CAMI SHROEDER,"I'm Cami Shroeder, by the way. Win's wife.",8
SCULLY,Nice to meet you. I'm Laura.,6
MOVER,Yeah. Where's this go?,4
MULDER,"Uh, you can put that in the driveway.",8
WIN SHROEDER,"Whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on. Let's... let's talk. Um... A b-ball fan, huh? Shooting hoops-- that's, um, that's not good. That's going to stand out in your front yard over there.",32
MULDER,"Stand out, Win?",3
WIN SHROEDER,"Well, as in, uh... not be aesthetically pleasing... to the eye. But, hey, you know, maybe you can get special dispensation from Mr. Gogolak, president of our Homeowner's Association. I'd take it up with him but in the meantime, um... let's keep that in the garage.",46
MULDER,Just... put it in the garage.,6
WIN SHROEDER,"Okay. Let's finish getting you folks moved in. Let's go, people. Let's move! Move! the 7th. Hmm. Moving truck pulls away. MULDER stands in the doorway, arm around SCULLY and they wave at the smiling departing neighbors. As soon as the door is closed, SCULLY walks into the living room.)",50
MULDER,"Oh, yeah. Nothing weird going on around here. Hey... ooh, wait a minute. You didn't let me carry you over the threshold.",22
SCULLY,You ready?,2
MULDER,"Let's get it on, honey.",5
SCULLY,"All right, then.",3
SCULLY,Thanks to our friendly neighbors there will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement.,12
MULDER,Not that it makes much difference. This place is so clean you could build computer chips.,16
SCULLY,"Okay. 6:01 p.m., February 24. Agents Scully and Mulder in the former home of David and Nancy Kline who disappeared without a trace last July. The Klines were the third such couple to disappear since this neighborhood was built in 1991. All were apparently stable professional people with no history of violence, domestic discord or mental illness and it took a family member or employee to realize that they were gone including their cars and a few personal items. What local police found in each case was nothing-- just impeccably-manicured homes and a community of neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared.",104
MULDER,That's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly.,12
SCULLY,"The local police departments were at a dead end so they turned to the FBI. AD Skinner, in assigning us this case thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be if we went undercover posing as prospective home buyers as this planned community would seem to hide a dark, possibly murderous conspiracy of silence.",55
MULDER,You want to make that honeymoon video now?,8
SCULLY,Rob and Laura Petrie?,4
MULDER,"""Pee-trie.""",1
SCULLY,"Mulder, if we ever go undercover again I get to choose the names, okay?",14
MULDER,Fine.,1
SCULLY,It just tells me that you're not taking this seriously.,10
MULDER,I'm taking it seriously. I just don't understand why we're on it. It's our first catch back on the X-Files. This isn't an X-File.,24
SCULLY,"Sure it is. It's unexplained. What do you want, aliens? Tractor beams?",12
MULDER,Wow. Admit it: you just want to play house.,9
MULDER,"Woman, get back in here and make me a sandwich!",10
MULDER,Did I not make myself clear?,6
SCULLY,"Hi. Well, you didn't need to do that.",8
BIG MIKE,"Oh, please. I have more dishes than I need. I just usually use one and then... wash it. Uh... I'm... uh, Mike Raskub, by the way.",26
SCULLY,Hi.,1
BIG MIKE,"Big Mike, for obvious reasons. I just live the next street over.",12
SCULLY,"Oh. That's a caduceus. Are you a doctor, Mike?",9
BIG MIKE,"No, a vet. Veterinarian. If you folks are thinking about getting a dog or any pet I'd be happy to check it out for you, no charge. Just, uh... you're not allowed to have over 16 pounds of pet. That's one of the CC&Rs.",44
SCULLY,"Mighty nice of you, Mike. I, uh... gosh, with all this hospitality, I can't believe the Klines ever left. That, uh... that was their name, wasn't it? The, uh, the Klines?",31
BIG MIKE,I have to go.,4
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,The name... is Rob.,4
SCULLY,What you got there?,4
MULDER,Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot. That look like blood to you?,16
SCULLY,Mm-hmm. How'd it get way up there?,7
PAT VERLANDER,"I, uh... didn't really learn much about them. He just said he works at home, which tells me she's got money.",21
CAMI SHROEDER,Well... seemed nice. Cute couple.,5
BIG MIKE,"Mmm, very cute. Uh, they're a nice couple.",8
WIN SHROEDER,"What do you think, Gene?",5
GENE GOGOLAK,"Ladies, my compliments to the chef.",6
PAT VERLANDER,Cami? Sissy?,2
GENE GOGOLAK,"These Petries, are they going to play ball?",8
WIN SHROEDER,"""Pee-tries."" Uh, so far, so good. I'm keeping my eye on them.",12
BIG MIKE,"Um... Mr. Gogolak... Don't you think that, uh... maybe this time it would be better if we told them?",19
WIN SHROEDER,Mike... you and I have been through this before. We... we don't know yet if we can trust them.,19
BIG MIKE,It's just that... There are so many... so many rules. I think that maybe they would be able to keep up with them better if they knew what happened if they don't. It's the neighborly thing to do. I really think we should do this.,45
GENE GOGOLAK,Son... Godspeed.,2
BIG MIKE,"Thank you. Um... can I, uh, use your...?",8
GENE GOGOLAK,Second door to the left.,5
GENE GOGOLAK,"There's Glade under the sink. Gordy, how about you go make sure he finds it.",15
WIN SHROEDER,Gene? I can talk him out of this.,8
GENE GOGOLAK,Win. The boy's a weak link and a strong chain can't survive with a weak link.,16
DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR,"... is instinctive and necessary for survival. Failure to conform within the tribal structure can often prove lethal. When group elders suspect such an outcast within their midst tribal members gather in a circle to perform a ritual chant in the belief this will expose the unwitting conduit of evil. The chanters eventually settle on the so-called severely, sometimes with death.""]",60
BIG MIKE,"Oh, no.",2
BIG MIKE,Agh!,1
BIG MIKE,"Come on. Come on. Come on. Ah, yes.",8
BIG MIKE,"No... No... No, I fixed it! I fixed it!",9
MULDER,Morning.,1
WIN SHROEDER,"Oh! Oh, Rob, Laura. I'm so sorry. So, good morning. So how was your first night? Peaceful?",17
MULDER,"Oh, it was wonderful. We just spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats. Isn't that right, Honeybunch?",19
SCULLY,"That's right, Poopyhead. Win, are we in the right place? I thought this was Big Mike's house.",17
WIN SHROEDER,Yeah... Yeah. I'm just helping out. Mike had to leave town on business.,13
SCULLY,What kind of business? I thought he was a veterinarian.,10
WIN SHROEDER,"Veterinarian business, I guess. I just know he's gone weeks at a time.",13
MULDER,I'll just leave this here then.,6
WIN SHROEDER,Let me take those. Just... tidier-looking than leaving them on the front porch.,13
MULDER,"Be more aesthetically pleasing, huh?",5
WIN SHROEDER,"Exactly. Say, would you two like to join Cami and me for",12
SCULLY,That sounds great. Thanks.,4
WIN SHROEDER,Great.,1
MULDER,"Oh, Win uh, you mentioned, uh... that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop? Who was that again? Mr. Gogolak, was it?",26
GENE GOGOLAK,"All right, then, let's see. Basketball hoop and backboard. Portable. Nope, I'm sorry. It's not allowed.",16
MULDER,You're kidding?,2
GENE GOGOLAK,"I'm afraid not. Rules are rules. It may not sound like anything-- a simple basketball hoop-- but from there, it's just a few short steps to spinning daisy reflectors and a bass boat in the driveway.",36
MULDER,"In other words, anarchy.",4
GENE GOGOLAK,It may sound tough but ours is a system that works. That's why The Falls is one of the top-ranked planned communities in all of California. Most of our homeowners have been here since day one.,36
MULDER,"I love the decor here, Mr. Gogolak. Is it, um... Occidental?",11
GENE GOGOLAK,"Well, it's, uh, Nepalese and Tibetan, mostly. I go there twice a year on business.",15
MULDER,Oh.,1
GENE GOGOLAK,I run Pier 9 Imports. I can get you a great deal on rattan furniture if you're interested. Indoor only. Outdoor use is prohibited by our...... CC&Rs.,27
WIN SHROEDER,"Uh-uh, Scruffy. Go on, now. Sweetheart? Did you use the dolphin-safe tuna this time?",14
CAMI SHROEDER,"Dolphin-safe all the way, Honey.",5
WIN SHROEDER,We always use the dolphin-safe.,5
MULDER,"You've got to love those dolphins... although they're pretty tasty, too.",11
WIN SHROEDER,So... Where'd you two meet?,5
MULDER,"Actually, it was at a UFO conference.",7
WIN SHROEDER,Flying saucers? Interesting. Wouldn't have thought you folks would have been into that.,13
MULDER,"Well, it's not me so much as Laura. She's quite the New-Ager. I mean, she's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings, what have you. I mean, God bless her she's a sucker for all that stuff.",39
CAMI SHROEDER,"Well, I wouldn't have guessed that, would you?",8
WIN SHROEDER,Mm-mm.,1
SCULLY,No kidding.,2
MULDER,"Yeah. You know, Win, uh, when you, uh... when you told me this morning that Big Mike was out of town on business... I don't think that's true.",28
WIN SHROEDER,You don't?,2
MULDER,"Mmm. No, 'cause we called his office, didn't we, Honey?",10
SCULLY,We did.,2
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MULDER,"We're thinking about getting a dog so we wanted to call him and ask him his advice, whatever, and see if maybe his office had a forwarding number and they said, you know...",33
SCULLY,That he wasn't there. They didn't know where he was.,10
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"Do you know where he is, Win?",7
WIN SHROEDER,Really couldn't tell you.,4
MULDER,"Mmm. It's got to be something really freaky-deaky, hunh? I mean, for him to lie about it like that? Maybe he's got some wild secret life going on.",28
MULDER,But every community has its dark underbelly don't you think?,10
WIN SHROEDER,We don't have any underbelly. As far as I'm concerned this community is the American Dream.,16
CAMI SHROEDER,"Um... I'm sorry. I, um... realize that it's past time that I walk Scruffy.",14
SCULLY,Would you like company?,4
CAMI SHROEDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,So is this the American dream? This place?,8
CAMI SHROEDER,"Oh, uh... nice neighborhood, you know... just a lot of people who want the best for their families.",18
SCULLY,"So it's just not your dream. You know, Cami, I-I've noticed that you've, uh, walked us past Mike's house... twice. Are you worried about him?",25
CAMI SHROEDER,No... I don't really know what you mean.,8
CAMI SHROEDER,"Scruffy! Scruffy, come here! Scruffy, no! Scruffy! Come out here! Scruffy! Scruffy, come out of there.",16
SCULLY,. Let me take a look.,5
CAMI SHROEDER,Do you see him?,4
SCULLY,Uh-uh.,1
CAMI SHROEDER,"Oh, Scruffy, Scruffy, it's okay, it's okay. I got you. I got you. Oh...",14
SCULLY,What you got there?,4
CAMI SHROEDER,"Deep breath. That's a close one, huh? Yeah?",8
SCULLY,Let me wipe that off. That's a good boy.,9
CAMI SHROEDER,"Okay, let's get you home. Come on.",7
SCULLY,"All right, Lieutenant.",3
MULDER,Here. Caduceus.,2
SCULLY,Thank you. Local PD came up blank on...,8
SCULLY,Mike Raskub. No activity on his credit cards. No sighting of his '97 Mercury Villager.,15
MULDER,"Yeah, there's no sign of him in his house. I didn't see him in the storm drain, either. I take it he's dead, Scully.",24
SCULLY,Laura.,1
SCULLY,Think it's Win Shroeder?,4
MULDER,"Mmm, maybe Win cleaning up.",5
SCULLY,Cleaning up for who?,4
MULDER,I don't know.,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, speaking of cleaning up whoever taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste?",15
MULDER,"Hey, what do we know about this stuff?",8
SCULLY,I'm driving down to San Diego tomorrow and have it analyzed.,11
MULDER,All right.,2
SCULLY,Third warning: Toilet seat.,4
MULDER,Why kill Big Mike?,4
MULDER,Whoa!,1
SCULLY,What's missing here is intent. What would be the motive?,10
MULDER,"Compulsive neatness, or a lack thereof. Have you noticed how everybody around here is obsessed with the neighborhood rules and the CC&Rs? You know what? You fit in really well here.",31
SCULLY,And you don't.,3
MULDER,"Well, anyway, tomorrow I got a, uh, a surefire way of testing out my theory.",15
MULDER,"Come on, Laura, you know... we're married now.",8
SCULLY,"Scully, Mulder. Good night.",4
MULDER,The thrill is gone.,4
MULDER,Bring it on.,3
WIN SHROEDER,Stay here.,2
CAMI SHROEDER,"Stop him, Win.",3
WIN SHROEDER,Stay here!,2
CAMI SHROEDER,Stop him!,2
MULDER,"Hey, Win. Want to play ""horse""?",6
WIN SHROEDER,What the hell are you doing?,6
MULDER,What am I doing?,4
MULDER,What are you doing?,4
WIN SHROEDER,"Damn it, Rob, get off of it! Help me get this thing inside.",13
MULDER,Why? What's going to happen if we don't?,8
WIN SHROEDER,Fine. That's the way you want it?,7
MULDER,"It's just a basketball hoop, Win. I don't understand why you're getting all bent out of shape.",17
WIN SHROEDER,The CC&Rs don't allow it. You know that.,8
MULDER,What's the worst thing that could happen? I get fined?],10
WIN SHROEDER,You were warned.,3
MULDER,Warned about what?,3
CAMI SHROEDER,No! No! Please!,3
MULDER,Stop!,1
MULDER,Cami... you all right?,4
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, is that you?",4
MULDER,Scull...!,1
SCULLY,"Sorry, Mulder. Somebody was in the house.",7
MULDER,"Tidying up. Whoever it was, they put away my basketball hoop. Somebody's looking out after us, Scully which may not be a bad thing.",24
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,I got a look at that thing that's been scaring everybody and I take it back. This is an X-File.,20
GENE GOGOLAK,How's Cami?,2
WIN SHROEDER,"What did we do wrong, Gene? Was our welcome mat not to your liking? Did I coil my garden hose clockwise instead of counterclockwise?",24
GENE GOGOLAK,"Hold the phone, now. Are you saying that I had something to do with this?",15
WIN SHROEDER,Who else? The exact same thing-- the thing you had me do to Mike. Who else would do that?,19
GENE GOGOLAK,"Son, you'll want to take a deep breath... and rethink that theory. It's your next-door neighbor, Win. He's a rabble-rouser. He's trouble with a capital ""T."" And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch.",43
MULDER,Here we go. Yeah...I'm guessing there's one of these in every yard. I think this is how this thing travels-- where it lives.,23
SCULLY,In the ground. This huge creature you think you saw?,10
SCULLY,"Look, Mulder, huge creatures aside do you care to hear what I think?",13
MULDER,Always.,1
SCULLY,"These are the lab results from the San Diego PD. First of all, the stuff that we found on the fan blade-- the dried blood and scalp hairs? It's neither. The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush and the same goes for the sample we found on the dog's muzzle. It's coffee grounds, eggshells and motor oil with about 50 other constituents with a little mercurochrome for color. In other words, Mulder, it's garbage. Which makes perfect sense because this entire neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill.",99
MULDER,A landfill?,2
SCULLY,"Mm-hmm. We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere. It's just beneath the topsoil and that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas but... Mulder, I don't see how any of this has to do with the disappearances that we're investigating.",48
MULDER,"It does. Somehow, it's one and the same. The Klines?",10
SCULLY,Yeah?,1
MULDER,What if they're still here,5
SCULLY,"You mean buried in the yard? Well, once we start a forensic excavation, our cover's blown.",16
PAT VERLANDER,What in God's name are you doing?! God...!,8
MULDER,Putting in a pool.,4
PAT VERLANDER,"In the front yard?! Wh-wh-what are you, insane? Have you even looked at the CC&Rs? You-you can't just put in a swimming pool!",23
MULDER,Ah... It's not a swimming pool. It's a reflecting pool. I checked the rules. There's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool. It's very tranquil. You'd like it.,29
GENE GOGOLAK,Let him dig his own grave.,6
SCULLY,Hey. Mulder.,2
SCULLY,The Klines aren't down there. Maybe it's time you called it a night.,13
MULDER,"Tasteful, isn't it?",3
MULDER,"Gogolak. Hey, can you get an excavation team out here?",10
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,We need to dig deeper.,5
SCULLY,Where are you going?,4
MULDER,To price some rattan furniture.,5
SCULLY,"Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace.",17
SCULLY,"No, not tomorrow. Tonight.",4
SCULLY,I'm sorry. Can I call you back?,7
SCULLY,Jeez.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, god.",2
BIG MIKE,"It's come for you, Laura. You can't make a noise. Shh. Shh.",12
SCULLY,Mike. Mike. What happened to you?,6
BIG MIKE,You have to get out of here.,7
SCULLY,Why?,1
SCULLY,What are you talking about? Who's downstairs?,7
BIG MIKE,"Shh, shh, shh.",3
SCULLY,Mike... who did this to you?,6
BIG MIKE,The ubermenscher. It's our fault. The original homeowners-- we asked for it and now we can't stop it.,18
SCULLY,"Stop what, Mike?",3
BIG MIKE,"I tried to give it Shroeder. You know, tit-for-tat. Just like Shroeder did for me.",15
SCULLY,"Mike, listen, settle down. Okay. Just give me my gun. I'm a federal agent...",14
BIG MIKE,"The ubermenscher wants you, Laura. Your husband-- he's broken way too many rules. I've been hiding in the sewer. I tried to warn him.",24
SCULLY,"Mike, just give me the gun. Give me...",8
GENE GOGOLAK,FBI? What did I do?,5
MULDER,Let's start with the Klines. You're responsible for them being in little pieces in my front yard. You gave them that lawn ornament. The guy with the axe?,28
GENE GOGOLAK,Whirligig.,1
MULDER,"Yeah, whirligig. It's tacky enough to break your rules and your CCRs-- tacky enough to mark the Klines for death.",20
GENE GOGOLAK,And won't that sound good in a court of law? When the judge asks you who killed the Klines what exactly are you going to tell him?,27
MULDER,"A tulpa. It's a Tibetan thought-form. It's a living, breathing creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability-- an ability I think you picked up on your whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East. Why'd you do it? I mean, is it so damn important for everybody to have the same color mailbox?",54
GENE GOGOLAK,It's important that people fit in.,6
MULDER,"But you didn't know exactly what you were getting into, did you? I mean, you can summon its existence, but... you can give it life, but you can't control it. The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way.",43
GENE GOGOLAK,"Son, my lawyers are going to make you sound so stupid that not only will I never see the inside of a jail cell but you'll be signing all your paychecks straight to me.",34
WIN SHROEDER,Gene?,1
GENE GOGOLAK,Win. You've got two FBI agents living next door to you. Cheer up. It's not for long.,17
MULDER,Scully? Scully?,2
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,"Scully, hang on.",3
GENE GOGOLAK,"Come here. Help me with this. Win, come here. Win...",10
CAMI SHROEDER,"Win, Win, Win. No. No. He deserves what he gets.",10
SCULLY,"Mulder, it was here.",4
[CLOSED CAPTIONING,"""It attacked Big Mike. Where is he? Is he alive?""]",10
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
SCULLY,"Several residents of the falls have now come forward to blame the deaths in the neighborhood on Home Owner Association President Gene Gogolak. These same residents deny Agent Mulder's allegations that they were in some sense all responsible for the demise of Gogolak himself claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him. It would seem the code of silence that hid the sins of this community has not only survived but-- in its creator-- claimed a final victim. Meanwhile, the Falls at Arcadia has been named one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running.",99
