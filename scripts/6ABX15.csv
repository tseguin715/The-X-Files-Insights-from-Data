SKINNER,You in charge here?,4
LIEUTENANT KRASKOW,Lieutenant Kraskow. Is the Bureau taking over?,7
SKINNER,"You're welcome to any help that I can give you, but that's not why I'm here. What can you tell me?",21
LIEUTENANT KRASKOW,"Silent alarm tripped 30 minutes ago. We think there's one robber, armed. Probably a handgun. Definitely no pro or he would have been long gone. A single gunshot about 20 minutes ago. Blinds are down but we think we've got a body on the floor. But you're not here to take over?",52
SKINNER,Two of my agents might be in there.,8
PAM,Skinner! Skinner!,2
COP,Hold it right here.,4
SKINNER,Do I know you?,4
PAM,Stop this. Don't let this happen!,6
SCULLY,"You're in charge here, you know. It doesn't have to end like this.",13
BERNARD,"Yeah, it does.",3
SCULLY,Nooooooo!!!!,1
MULDER,Son of a...,3
MULDER,"Yes... Yes. curses under his breath and quickly walks out of his bedroom stepping over his athletic shoes. The phone rings. He tosses the useless cell phone to the floor in the living room and grabs a small pot from the kitchen and goes back to the bedroom, but trips over the athletic shoes and lands flat on the wet floor on his face and stomach. He slowly crawls to the phone and answers it. He puts the pot in position to catch the water.)",85
MULDER,Hello? …. It's coming through down there? … Ugh! … It's my damn waterbed. My damn waterbed sprung a leak. …I-I-I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed. … I don't know what to tell you. … I-I think it was a gift. … All right.,47
MULDER,I know. I missed the meeting.,6
SCULLY,You didn't miss the meeting. You're extraordinarily late for the meeting. It's still going on.,15
MULDER,What are you doing down here?,6
SCULLY,"We took a short break and I came looking for you. What are you doing down here, Mulder?",18
MULDER,"I'm having the best damn day of my life. Any moment I'm about to burst into song-- ""Zip a dee doo dah."" My, uh, waterbed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock. My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the, uh, damages is going to bounce if I don't deposit my pay. You ever have one of those days, Scully?",74
SCULLY,"Since I've been working here? Yeah. When did you get a waterbed, Mulder?",13
MULDER,"Bank's just down the street. I'll be back in ten. Cover for me, will you?",15
SCULLY,When do I not?,4
DRIVER,Jerk!,1
BERNARD,Yeah? You want some? We good? Pam?,7
PAM,Go run your errand already.,5
BERNARD,Yeah. I just got to go pick something up. No biggie.,11
PAM,"Right, Bernard. No biggie.",4
BERNARD,I'll be ten minutes. Wait here for me.,8
BICYCLIST,"Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!",9
BERNARD,You watch it!,3
PAM,Right on schedule. Poor guy.,5
PAM,You never did that before.,5
AGENT ARNOLD,"Now, that's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year. Um, other D.O.J. projections estimate a larger, uh, two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate versus the, uh, one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier, uh, Tanner study. However, there is some dispute that the, uh, statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J.-preferred methodology. In any case added variables make crime trends for the coming year particularly hard to predict.",81
SKINNER,The unpredictable future. Which brings us to Agent Mulder. Will he or will he not grace us with his report?,20
TELLER,"May I help the next in line, please?",8
CUSTOMER,I've got … a few transactions.,6
BERNARD,"Customers, face down! You know what this is!",8
WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,"Oh, god.",2
BERNARD,You! On the floor!,4
WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,"Oh, god, don't shoot us!",5
BERNARD,Shut up!,2
MULDER,You're the boss.,3
MULDER,It's all right.,3
BERNARD,"All right, I'm the boss! No silent alarms, no dye packs. Do it like the insurance company taught you. Start with the counter money. Quicker you go, quicker I go. Everybody else out here on the floor. Ahh! Leave the last one. No tricks. All right, come on. Come on.",50
MULDER,Zip a dee doo dah.,5
BERNARD,"All right, get your keys. Come around here. We're going to open up the ATM.",15
MULDER,"Hey, lock the doors. You forgot to lock the front door.",11
BERNARD,On the ground.,3
WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,No!!!,1
SCULLY,Drop it! Drop it now!,5
BERNARD,You drop it!,3
BERNARD,You drop it.,3
SKINNER,Travel expense reimbursement. Who's got those figures? All I've got here is third and fourth quarter.,16
AGENT ARNOLD,No?,1
SKINNER'S ASSISTANT,Assistant Director?,2
PAM,"Go, go, go.",3
SWAT TEAM LEADER,"Go, go, go!",3
COP,Sir.,1
SKINNER,Who's in charge here?,4
LIEUTENANT KRASKOW,I am. Unless the Bureau's taking over.,7
PAM,Skinner!,1
COP,"Hey, hold it!",3
PAM,Skinner! Don't let them charge in there. Skinner!,8
SKINNER,Do I know you?,4
PAM,Skinner!,1
BERNARD,"They're supposed to call, right?",5
SCULLY,They're not going to call. What's your name?,8
BERNARD,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"Look, I got to call you something, right? How about Steve? It's a nice... honest name. Steve.",17
BERNARD,Bernard.,1
SCULLY,Bernard. I have to get my partner out of here.,10
BERNARD,I am blowing this whole freaking place right off the map if they come in here.,16
SCULLY,"Oh... look, they don't know that. Don't you realize that? They can't see you. They don't know what your plan is.",21
BERNARD,They better know. They damn well better figure it out.,10
SCULLY,Look... just walk in front of the door and show them.,11
BERNARD,You want to get me killed.,6
SCULLY,I just want everybody to live. That's all. I just... just show them. You have control over everything that happens here. You do. And it doesn't have to end this way.,31
BERNARD,"Yeah, it does.",3
SCULLY,Noooooo!!!!,1
MULDER,"Oh, son of a...",4
MULDER,Son of a bitch.,4
MULDER,Oh... that's great.,3
MULDER,"Yeah? … It's coming through down there? … It's my damn waterbed. … It sprung a leak. … Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed. … I don't know what to tell you. … I... I... I'm sorry. I mean, I...",44
BERNARD,Who you calling?,3
PAM,Nobody.,1
BERNARD,"What do you mean, nobody? It's got to be somebody.",10
PAM,"It's nobody you know, Bernard. Forget it.",7
BERNARD,There's something I got to do. I want you to come.,11
PAM,I'm not going with you.,5
BERNARD,"Look, I'm not asking. Pam? Don't go getting all weird on me. It'll only take a couple of minutes.",19
PAM,"Look, Bernard,... just go to work. It's not too late.",10
BERNARD,I'm not going to work today. And don't say they're going to fire me.,14
PAM,I wasn't going to say that.,6
BERNARD,'Cause you know what? Who cares? Like there's a big future in mopping floors. Like that's something to lose.,19
PAM,We lose everything.,3
BERNARD,"No, no. I got a plan. This time tomorrow, Pam...",10
PAM,Everything will be roses.,4
MULDER,Aw... Damn it.,3
MULDER,I know. I missed the meeting.,6
SCULLY,"Well, not yet, but, uh, only because it's the longest in FBI history.",13
MULDER,"What are you doing down here, then?",7
SCULLY,"Well, I came looking for you. We took a five-minute break three minutes ago. Mulder, your cell phone's not working. Did you oversleep?",23
MULDER,"Scully, did you ever have one of those days you wish you could rewind and start all over again from the beginning?",22
SCULLY,"Yes. Frequently. But, I mean, who's … who's to say that if you did rewind it and start over again that it wouldn't end up exactly the same way?",29
MULDER,So you think it's all just fate? We have no free will?,12
SCULLY,"No, I think that we're free to be the people that we are-- good, bad or indifferent. I think that it's our character that determines our fate.",27
MULDER,"And all the rest is just preordained? I don't buy that. There's too many variables. Too many forks in the road. I meant to be on time to work this morning but my waterbed springs a leak flooding my apartment and the apartment below me so that makes me late for the meeting. Then I realize I got to write a check to cover the damages to my landlord but, as I'm walking to work, I realize that that's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay. So now I got to go to the bank, which makes me even later.",100
SCULLY,Since when did you get a waterbed?,7
MULDER,"I might just as easily not have a waterbed then I'd be on time for this meeting. You might just as easily have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI, and then we would never have met. Blah, blah, blah...",42
SCULLY,Fate.,1
MULDER,"Free will. With every choice, you change your fate.",9
SCULLY,"Then let's change yours. I will deposit your check. You gather your files, go to Skinner's office, give your report before he takes it out on both of us.",29
MULDER,I endorsed my damn check stub.,6
PAM,Mulder! Don't go in the bank today.,7
MULDER,Excuse me?,2
PAM,Bernard's in there. Please don't go in the bank.,9
MULDER,I'm sorry. Do I know you?,6
PAM,"You pass me every day on the street. Every single day. This day, on your way to the bank. And then you go inside, and everybody gets killed-- you, your partner, Bernard, everybody",33
MULDER,. I pass you... and then we die.,7
PAM,"Yes. Over and over. Only... only last time you looked at me, you looked at me like you knew me. Like you remembered. Please remember me.",26
PAM,Don't go.,2
MULDER,Drop your weapon!,3
SCULLY,Drop it.,2
BERNARD,I ain't dropping nothing. You put yours down. I'll shoot her!,11
MULDER,What do you think I'll do then?,7
MULDER,"Bernard... that's your name, right?",5
SCULLY,"Bernard, she's not dead. You're not a murderer yet.",9
MULDER,You can end this the right way.,7
TELLER,"Sir, please. Listen to them. Don't hurt anybody else. A whole lot of police are coming.",16
BERNARD,You tripped the alarm.,4
MULDER,Noooo!!!,1
MULDER,"Yeah, I know. … Yeah, I know. I-I know already. … I'll pay for it.",15
RECORDING,The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding … reach cannot take your call at this... ),19
PAM,Agent Scully...,2
SCULLY,Yes?,1
PAM,Please don't go inside the bank today.,7
SCULLY,The bank?,2
PAM,Cradock Marine-- Eighth Street branch a block from here.,9
SCULLY,Uh... I'm not following. Did-did you get separated from your tour?,11
PAM,"I'm here to see you. I'm begging you... please don't go this time. Don't let Mulder go, either.",18
SCULLY,Um... I'm sorry...,3
TOUR GUIDE,"Excuse me, miss? You're not supposed to be in this area.",11
PAM,"If you walk in that bank, you'll die. Both of you.",11
MULDER,"Oh, hey.",2
SCULLY,Hey.,1
MULDER,Did I miss the meeting?,5
SCULLY,"Huh? No. No, we, uh, took a five-minute break about, uh, three minutes ago. Uh, Mulder, your cell phone's not working.",21
MULDER,"Wow, that is so strange.",5
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,I just got the weirdest sensation of deja vu. I've been having it all morning.,15
SCULLY,"Well, that's fairly common.",4
MULDER,"Yeah, but never to this degree. I mean, I woke up, I opened my eyes I was soaking wet...",19
MULDER,It's a long story but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before.,17
SCULLY,"Well, you may have. Did you do a lot of drinking in college?",13
MULDER,I wonder what it means.,5
SCULLY,"Mulder, I don't see why it has to mean anything.",10
MULDER,"Well, you know, some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious. That it represents a desire to, uh, have a second chance to set things right.",32
SCULLY,Set what kind of things right?,6
MULDER,Whatever's wrong.,2
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's more likely that we're talking about simple neurochemistry-- a glitch in the brain's ability to process recognition and memory. Doesn't mean that the memory's authentic.",27
MULDER,"Yeah? Well, but what if it were?",7
SCULLY,What if you'd lived this moment before and now you're living it again?,13
MULDER,Yeah-- so that I could right some wrong or change fate.,11
SCULLY,"Well, right now I'd say you're fated to go to this meeting.",12
MULDER,"No. Actually, I'm fated to go to the bank.",9
SCULLY,Mulder... what bank?,3
MULDER,Cradock. Right down the street.,5
SCULLY,Eighth Street.,2
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,Some... some woman just stopped me in the hallway not ten minutes ago. She knew both of our names and she warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street. She said that we'd die.,39
MULDER,What did she look like?,5
SCULLY,"Five-eight, thin, green eyes, dyed hair. M-maybe you know her. Maybe... it's just somebody pulling a prank.",17
MULDER,I'll use the ATM machine. I don't want to tempt fate.,11
SKINNER,"All right, our next order of business is federal crime projections. Who's got those figures?",15
AGENT ARNOLD,"Uh, right here. Um, if you all could just bear with me one second. Uh, ""federal crime projections.""",18
PAM,Do you remember me?,4
MULDER,"You match a description. You're the, uh...you're the woman that gave a warning to my partner, aren't you? Uh... Have we met?",22
PAM,"More times than I can count. Right here on this sidewalk. Usually, you walk right by. You'll pass a few minutes earlier a few minutes later-- little details, they change. But it always ends the same.",36
MULDER,What always ends the same?,5
PAM,I keep having this conversation.,5
MULDER,We go inside the bank... and we all die. That's what you told my partner. Is... is something going to happen inside the bank? Is there going to be a robbery?,31
PAM,Every time I tell you there's going to be a robbery you run in there to try to stop it and that's when things go bad. Don't you see? We're all in hell. I'm the only one who knows it. Something went very wrong on this day the first time around. Something got screwed up. Things didn't end the way they were supposed to. Now it's like a needle stuck in a groove.,73
MULDER,You're saying this day repeats over and over again.,9
PAM,"Until we get it right. Till my boyfriend doesn't blow up that bank. I have tried everything to stop him. I've hid his keys, I've drugged his coffee... I even called the police on him myself. He always gets here. He's meant to. It's you. It's you and your partner every time. If it wasn't for you, nobody would die.",60
MULDER,"If what you're saying is true, how come I don't remember it? How come you're the only one?",18
PAM,That's got to be 50 times you've asked me that.,10
MULDER,51. What's the answer?,4
PAM,I don't know. I just do. Be glad you don't. Please... you can stop this. You're the variable. It has to be you. I have tried everyone else. All I'm asking is just walk away.,35
AGENT ARNOLD,"That's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year. Other D.O.J.. projections estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate, uh versus the, uh, one to one-and- a-half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study. However, there is some dispute that...",47
MULDER,"Um, excuse me uh... Agent Arnold. Um, where's Scully?",9
SKINNER,"She just left, Mulder -- I assume to look for you.",10
MULDER,"Uh, excuse me. Um...",4
AGENT ARNOLD,Umm….,1
BERNARD,"Everybody, face down! You know what this is! Give me the money.",12
WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,"Oh, God! Oh, God...",4
BERNARD,You! On the floor!,4
WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,"Oh, God, you're going to shoot us? Oh, God he's going to...",12
BERNARD,Shut up!,2
WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,He's going to shoot us! Please don't kill us! Please don't do this!,13
BERNARD,Shut up! Give me the money!,6
WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED,Don't shoot us! Don't shoot us!,6
BERNARD,"Damn it, shut up!",4
BERNARD,Hey! Hey! Get your hands up where I can see them! Do it! Do it now!,16
MULDER,Drop your weapon!,3
MULDER,He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.,32
MULDER,"I know, I know. I missed the meeting.",8
SCULLY,You didn't miss the meeting. You're extraordinarily late for the meeting.,11
MULDER,"The bank's just down the street. Cover for me, will you?",11
BERNARD,"We good, Pam? Pam?",4
PAM,I know-- you just got to go pick something up. No biggie.,12
BERNARD,What is with you? Why are you always in a mood?,11
PAM,'Cause nothing ever changes.,4
BERNARD,Things are going to change. You wait and see. I'll be ten minutes. Wait here for me.,17
BICYCLIST,"Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!",9
BERNARD,You watch it!,3
MULDER,Do I know you?,4
PAM,Do you?,2
MULDER,"Yeah, you just look really familiar to me.",8
PAM,Do I?,2
MULDER,"Yeah. No? Uh, all right. I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.",10
TELLER,"May I help the next in line, please?",8
MULDER,:...He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.,16
AGENT ARNOLD,"...estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate, uh, versus the one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study. However, there's some dispute that the statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J.-preferred methodology.",46
AGENT ARNOLD,"In any case, added variables make crime trends for the coming year...",12
SKINNER'S ASSISTANT,Excuse me. Agent Scully?,4
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
SKINNER'S ASSISTANT,"It's Agent Mulder, and he said it's urgent.",8
SCULLY,"Mulder, where are you?",4
MULDER,I'm at the bank.,4
SCULLY,"Yeah, I know where you are, but what's taking so long?",11
MULDER,"Scully, I need you to do something for me right now.",11
SCULLY,"Ma'am, will you come with me?",6
PAM,Why?,1
SCULLY,"Just come with me, please.",5
PAM,What's this about?,3
SCULLY,My partner said you'd know.,5
MULDER,Take it. I'm a federal agent. I don't want us all to die in here.,15
BERNARD,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,"You've got a girlfriend outside in the car and you've got a bomb. Something very bad is going to happen here today and I want you to know that I'm not going to let it happen. But if you walk out that door right now I'm not going to stop you. You're in charge here, Bernard.",56
BERNARD,You're damn right.,3
MULDER,You could change your fate.,5
BERNARD,Everybody down! Now! You know what this is!,8
WOMAN WHO UNFORTUNATELY NEVER GOT SLAPPED,"No! Oh, god!",3
BERNARD,Get down!,2
MULDER,"If you don't believe me, ask her.",7
SCULLY,Drop it!,2
BERNARD,"Get away from her, Pam.",5
PAM,This isn't gonna work. You can't be in here.,9
SCULLY,Drop it now!,3
BERNARD,You drop it.,3
MULDER,"Listen to me, Bernard...",4
BERNARD,You get her out of here.,6
MULDER,"You get her out of here. You're dooming her. You're making her live this day over and over again-- her, you, me, all of us.",25
BERNARD,What the hell are you talking about?,7
MULDER,Every day you die in here and every day it starts all over again. You can't want this for her. It's hell!,22
BERNARD,Hell? I'm doing this for her.,6
PAM,"Listen to him, Bernard.",4
BERNARD,Put your damn gun down!,5
MULDER,"Put your gun down, Scully. Trust me, it's the only way to get out of here. You got to put your gun down and let them out. He's got a bomb.",31
PAM,"Come on, Bernard. Let's go.",5
BERNARD,You son of a bitch!,5
PAM,No!,1
SCULLY,This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI…,8
PAM,This never happened before.,4
MULDER,Yeah?,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me. paper.)",4
MULDER,"I'm late again, aren't I, Scully?",6
SCULLY,"No, not yet but Skinner wants to see us in his office as soon as possible. He's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday.",25
MULDER,I'll be there in an hour.,6
SCULLY,"I'd like to hear it, too.",6
MULDER,"Well, you were there, Scully.",5
SCULLY,That's not what I mean. You still won't explain what happened yesterday-- how you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives.,22
MULDER,Call it a feeling.,4
SCULLY,And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car?,15
MULDER,I don't think she was an accomplice. I think she was just trying to get away.,16
SCULLY,Are you okay?,3
MULDER,I'll be there in an hour.,6
