JANITOR 2,Okay.,1
JANITOR 1,Santa maria san locos.,4
WORKER 1,What the hell is that?,5
WORKER 2,Hey! Get out of the way!,6
WORKER 3,"He's hurt bad, man!",4
WORKER 2,Hurry up! Get an ambulance!,5
BREWER,This is Wesley Brewer out on Route 7. Looks like down.,11
DISPATCHER,"10-4, Wesley.",2
BREWER,Mother of God!,3
WOMAN,"She was just lying there when we found her, officer.",10
SCULLY,So you saw nothing when the window broke? No one outside?,11
JANITOR 1,No.,1
JANITOR 2,Nothing.,1
JANITOR 1,We heard a noise like thunder. Then glass everywhere.,9
SCULLY,Okay. Thank you.,3
MULDER,What did the janitors say?,5
SCULLY,They claim they didn't see anything.,6
MULDER,That's not surprising. The security monitors don't have a recording of anything either. Just a giant implosion of glass like some kind of giant shock wave.,26
SCULLY,What the janitors describe sounds more like a sonic boom.,10
MULDER,"No sonic boom did this. The construction worker who was killed had his spine crushed like a string of seashells, a circular abrasion on his torso in roughly the shape of an elephant's foot. Other workers at the site said they felt the ground shake followed by a faint whiff of animal odor in the wind.",56
SCULLY,"Mulder, if you're still suggesting that the elephant did this, it just defies logic. Somebody would have seen it.",19
MULDER,"Well, if somebody would have seen it, Scully, we wouldn't be here. Another vehicle would have left evidence of a collision - distress to the metal, or paint. I can see signs of neither of those things. I'd be willing to admit the possibility of a tornado but it's not really tornado season. I'd even be willing to entertain the notion of a black hole passing over the area...... or some cosmic anomaly, but it's not really black hole season, either. If I was a betting man I'd say that it was, uh,...",92
SCULLY,An invisible elephant?,3
MULDER,I saw David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear once.,11
MEECHAM,Agent Mulder?,2
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MEECHAM,"Ed Meecham, Fairfield Zoo. Sorry for the holdup. We had trouble transporting Ganesha's body this morning.",16
MULDER,This is Agent Scully.,4
MEECHAM,Hi.,1
SCULLY,Have they determined what he died of?,7
MEECHAM,"She. Ganesha was a 12-year-old Indian female. Near as I can figure, she ran herself into exhaustion.",17
MULDER,How did she escape?,4
MEECHAM,"Well now, there's a puzzle. When I got the call this morning, I expected to find her cage open or something but it was locked tight just like I left it.",31
MULDER,Any idea how she could have escaped a locked cage?,10
MEECHAM,"No, sir. No signs of tampering.",6
MULDER,"I've read about something called the elephant rebellion in zoos across the country - a high incidence of elephants turning on their keepers, destroying their pens. Was Ganesha ever a problem like that?",32
MEECHAM,"Elephants are very big, very willful animals.",7
MULDER,So you're saying there were problems?,6
MEECHAM,"Well, the person you're gonna want to talk to about that is Willa Ambrose.",14
SCULLY,Ambrose?,1
MEECHAM,"She's a naturalist. She was hired by the Board of Supervisors last year to oversee things. Well, now she's supposed to be the reigning authority.",25
MULDER,"Well, let me ask you something. In your opinion, the damage here on the street - could this have been caused by an escaped elephant?",24
MEECHAM,In my honest opinion?,4
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MEECHAM,Sure. Will you excuse me?,5
SCULLY,"What're you looking for, Mulder?",5
MULDER,A local paper. I want to see if David Copperfield's in town.,12
SCULLY,Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose.,7
WORKER,There.,1
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
WORKER,Sure.,1
SCULLY,Miss Ambrose?,2
WILLA AMBROSE,Yes.,1
SCULLY,I'm Agent Dana Scully. This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.,12
WILLA AMBROSE,How can I help you?,5
SCULLY,"Well, a federal employee was fatally injured last night, and there seems to be a case developing around the elephant that escaped from your zoo.",25
WILLA AMBROSE,It was my understanding that the eyewitnesses to the accident said that they didn't know how the man was killed.,20
MULDER,"Actually, what we're trying to determine is how Ganesha escaped.",10
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, what did Ed tell you?",6
MULDER,"He said he found the cage locked, the same way he left it.",13
WILLA AMBROSE,What more can I say?,5
MULDER,"I don't want to belabor this, but a man was found trampled to death. An animal from your zoo was found 43 miles from here. No one's looking to place any blame, we're just trying to understand the facts that led up to this incident.",45
WILLA AMBROSE,This is where Ganesha was held when she wasn't in her habitat.,12
MULDER,Who has keys to this lock?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,"Only myself and Mr. Meecham. Otherwise, this is a restricted area. Elephants aren't particularly good jumpers if that's what you're thinking.",21
SCULLY,"No, I was just wondering why such a small pen for such a large animal.",15
WILLA AMBROSE,"The zoo was built in the 1940s. The pens and habitats are all too confining. I was brought on to expand and create more humane environments. Unfortunately, these things take time.",31
MULDER,"Those, uh, chains on the ground there?",7
WILLA AMBROSE,Those are tie-downs. They're meant to restrict the animal's movement. I disallowed their use when I came to work here.,20
MULDER,Disallowed their use by whom?,5
WILLA AMBROSE,"It was Ed Meecham's practice. It reflected an old, nonprogressive zoo policy.",12
MULDER,How's your relationship with Ed Meecham?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,"I'm his boss and I'm a woman, and Ed doesn't like that much.",13
SCULLY,Would he be vindictive enough to let Ganesha go as an act of sabotage?,14
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, if he did that would be foolish. The facility is running at a deficit and in danger of losing its funding.",22
MULDER,Have you spoken about the incident with Ed?,8
WILLA AMBROSE,No. I think Ed's got enough dealing with the W.A.O.,10
SCULLY,W.A.O?,1
MULDER,It's the Wild Again Organization - they're a radical group that believes any captive animal is a crime against nature.,19
WILLA AMBROSE,Believe me they're gonna have a field day with this one. Excuse me.,13
KYLE LANG,"The W.A.O. believes only tragedy results from keeping animals in captivity. In the wild, an elephant like that would roam an area 20 square miles, minimum. Ganesha weighed in excess of 5000 pounds, and she was being held in a 50 by 50 foot cage.",45
SCULLY,And you consider that inhumane treatment?,6
KYLE LANG,It's like you or I living in a pickle barrel.,10
SCULLY,"According to FBI files, you've been arrested over a dozen times for activities involving the kidnapping of circus and zoo animals.",21
KYLE LANG,The W.A.O. sees it as liberation.,6
SCULLY,Hmmm. Were you involved in the liberation of Ganesha?,9
KYLE LANG,"That would make me an accessory to murder, wouldn't it? Endangering these animals is against everything we believe. These are incredibly spiritual creatures. Their rituals and behavior are linked to a past no man ever witnessed. Did you know they actually bury their dead? They can visit an elephant graveyard centuries old and know instinctively where the bones of their ancient ancestors lie.",63
MULDER,What do you think Ganesha was running from?,8
KYLE LANG,You want to see what she was running from? I'll show you.,12
KYLE LANG,This is how Ed Meecham treats these majestic animals.,9
MULDER,This is still going on?,5
KYLE LANG,Ed Meecham's a barbarian. He's been torturing animals at the Fairfield Zoo for years. We figure he's still at it. Eventually we're gonna get some proof. We're here to put pressure on the zoo. We're keeping track of what goes on there.,42
MULDER,Even though Willa Ambrose claims that she's put a stop to most of his old practices?,16
KYLE LANG,"Whatever Willa Ambrose's intentions, she's too preoccupied to really know how Meecham operates.",13
SCULLY,Preoccupied with what?,3
KYLE LANG,A lawsuit she's fighting against the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla named Sophie. Willa rescued her from a north African customs house ten years ago. Raised her like a child. Now the Malawi government wants her back.,38
SCULLY,Will they win?,3
KYLE LANG,This is a perfect example of man's imperialism over the animal kingdom - this craven impulse to turn animals into objects for our own selfish pleasure.,25
SCULLY,I thought you said she rescued this gorilla.,8
KYLE LANG,"Yeah, rescued her so she could spend a life behind bars. Her obligation should have been to return the gorilla to the wild. All animals should run free.",28
SCULLY,Even if that means trampling a man to death?,9
KYLE LANG,Maybe he should have gotten out of the way.,9
MULDER,"I'm sure he would have if he'd seen it coming. Thanks for your time, sir, and we'll get back to you soon.",22
MULDER,"It's all happening at the zoo, Scully.",7
SCULLY,"Well, we found our suspects.",5
MULDER,You think they busted out the elephant?,7
SCULLY,"Well, you heard the man - ""all animals should run free.""",10
MULDER,"What about all the eyewitness accounts, the security tapes from the video camera, the fact no one saw an elephant until it was miles away from the zoo?",28
SCULLY,"Well, the lights they were using at the construction site were mercury vapor, 10,000 candlepower. They can restrict a man's ability to adjust his vision to the dark. And their security cameras are poor quality. A gray elephant may not have registered an image on tape in the dim light in front of the building.",55
MULDER,"Ah, I'm not buying it, Scully. I think these guys are all talk.",13
SCULLY,"These guys are dedicated to exactly this kind of activity, unabashedly. Did you check out the night vision camera they had lying on the shelf?",25
MULDER,No.,1
SCULLY,It wouldn't surprise me if they tried to capitalize on their success.,12
MULDER,By doing what?,3
SCULLY,By liberating another animal. Willa Ambrose said that the zoo was in trouble financially. A loss of another big exhibit could shut them down entirely.,25
MULDER,All right. You keep an eye on the W.A.O.,9
SCULLY,And where are you going?,5
MULDER,Talk to the animals.,4
FROHIKE,"Beam me up, Scotty.",4
MULDER,"Did anybody ever tell you the camera loves you, Frohike?",10
FROHIKE,"Yeah, the arresting officers at the ""Free James Brown"" rally.",10
BYERS,"So what's this costing the taxpayers, Mulder?",7
MULDER,"Uh, about 150 bucks an hour.",6
FROHIKE,Ouch. Almost as much as Bill Clinton's haircuts.,8
MULDER,Where's Langley?,2
BYERS,He has a philosophical issue with having his image bounced off a satellite.,13
FROHIKE,What are you doing in Idaho?,6
MULDER,I'm in the town of Fairfield. What do you know about it?,12
BYERS,"They got a little zoo there. Lots of strange lore - animals escaping, disappearing without a trace.",16
MULDER,Any idea why?,3
FROHIKE,You're not far from the Mountain Home Air Base. Major UFO hot spot.,13
BYERS,"Weird fact, Mulder. No animal at Fairfield Zoo has ever brought a pregnancy to term.",15
FROHIKE,Not a cub or a chick.,6
BYERS,"The woman who runs the zoo has a gorilla that knows sign language - supposedly with a vocabulary of 1,000 words.",20
FROHIKE,"If that's the lovely Agent Scully, let her know I've been working out. I'm buff.",15
MULDER,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me. I was right. I just followed the kid from the W.A.O. to the zoo. He's just about to make it over the fence.",26
MULDER,"All right, I'll be right there, Scully.",7
ED MEECHAM,What the hell are you doing here?,7
SCULLY,There's a member of the W.A.O. on the premises.,9
ED MEECHAM,Come with me.,3
SCULLY,What's going on?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,"It's okay, Sophie. Calm down.",5
KYLE LANG,I don't know what you're talking about.,7
SCULLY,You have no idea what he was doing at the zoo?,11
KYLE LANG,"If you're asking me if I have any idea of his intentions, the answer is simple. Not the slightest.",19
SCULLY,What if I said I saw this camera sitting up there on the shelf yesterday?,15
KYLE LANG,Guess I never noticed it before.,6
SCULLY,"A tiger is missing, and a member of your organization is dead. For such a principled man, you show an amazing lack of emotion.",24
KYLE LANG,"If the tiger killed this person, then it was a natural act.",12
SCULLY,"Well, if I find evidence that he was releasing those animals under your orders, I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life behind bars.",26
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,"You know, that guy really pisses me off.",8
MULDER,"You okay, Scully?",3
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,You calmed down?,3
SCULLY,Have they found the tiger yet?,6
MULDER,"No, but I looked at the cassette from the kid's recorder. He wasn't killed by the tiger.",17
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,"Unless it's trick photography, that kid was killed by some kind of phantom attacker.",14
SCULLY,"You saw his body, Mulder. That kid was mauled to death. He had deep claw marks on his chest and on his back.",23
MULDER,"I can't explain it either, but I know someone who might be able to.",14
MULDER,Excuse me? Miss Ambrose? May we have a word with you?,11
WILLA AMBROSE,I don't know anything more than I've already told the police. I have nothing to say.,16
MULDER,Is this where you keep Sophie?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,Sophie is ill.,3
MULDER,You think we could meet her? We're not here to try to take her away from you.,17
WILLA AMBROSE,"About six weeks ago I had to take Sophie out of her public habitat. She'd become so withdrawn and depressed, she'd curl into a ball in the corner of her cage and just shiver.",34
MULDER,Did you ask her why?,5
WILLA AMBROSE,All the time.,3
MULDER,What'd she say?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,"""Light afraid."" Literally, she's afraid of the light.",8
SCULLY,She speaks to you?,4
WILLA AMBROSE,Over 600 words using American sign language. She understands over a thousand. I'll show you her vocabulary list.,18
SCULLY,"Is this who you wanted to speak to, Mulder?",9
MULDER,"It's basic investigative procedure, Agent Scully - interview all possible witnesses.",10
WILLA AMBROSE,"Gorillas are highly sensitive creatures, and Sophie's use of language skills makes her even more so.",16
SCULLY,Why would she be afraid of the light?,8
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, you've obviously heard about the trouble with the Malawi government. There's a chance that Sophie could be taken away from me, and I think that she knows that.",29
MULDER,Are these Sophie's?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,Yes.,1
MULDER,What do you think they mean?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, until recently Sophie desperately wanted a baby. The brown object in the center is her expression of that.",19
MULDER,Have you tried to mate her?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,We were looking for a partner but under these stressful conditions I didn't want to put her through it.,19
MULDER,Do you have a veterinary facility here?,7
WILLA AMBROSE,Yeah.,1
MULDER,"All right, this may seem like a rather strange request but it might help explain what's been going on here. I'm gonna need your help on this, too, Scully.",29
SCULLY,"I hope you know what you're getting us into, Mulder.",10
MULDER,I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find.,8
SCULLY,This isn't exactly in my job description.,7
MULDER,"And the next thing you know, they'll be doing it on MTV Sports.",13
WILLA AMBROSE,Okay. The elephant's cavity is clear. I'm ready for you.,10
WILLA AMBROSE,The knife's right down there.,5
SCULLY,Okay.,1
MULDER,I've been told there's never been a successful pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo.,13
WILLA AMBROSE,Sounds like you've been talking to Kyle Lang.,8
MULDER,"Well, is it true?",4
WILLA AMBROSE,Yes. But I don't think for the reasons Kyle claims - not because Ed Meecham has done anything to these animals.,20
MULDER,Why then?,2
WILLA AMBROSE,Because bringing a pregnancy to term in captivity is always difficult.,11
MULDER,But a perfect failure rate?,5
WILLA AMBROSE,I know. It's one of the things I was determined to change when I came to the zoo.,18
MULDER,Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha?,8
WILLA AMBROSE,No. Mating an elephant out of the wild is rarely successful. There have only been six elephants born in captivity over the last ten years.,25
WILLA AMBROSE,"Here's the uterine tissue, but I'm still not clear on what you expect to find.",15
SCULLY,"You're right, Mulder. The signs in the uterus and ovaries are unmistakable.",12
WILLA AMBROSE,So what did you find?,5
SCULLY,This animal had been pregnant.,5
WILLA AMBROSE,What are you talking about?,5
SCULLY,There's evidence of hyperplasia and the corpus luteum is ruptured.,10
WILLA AMBROSE,That's not possible.,3
MULDER,Neither is an invisible elephant.,5
WILLA AMBROSE,What is going on here?,5
MULDER,"Whatever it is it's been going on for some time, and I think you'll find evidence of the same thing when your tiger returns.",24
WORKER 1,I still can't believe you bet on the Chargers.,9
WORKER 2,You hear that?,3
WORKER 1,Hear what?,2
ED MEECHAM,Where's the tiger?,3
POLICEMAN,Somewhere inside the construction site. He's got two men trapped in there.,12
WILLA AMBROSE,"Put the gun away, Ed.",5
ED MEECHAM,"You want to be responsible for another death, Miss Ambrose?",10
WILLA AMBROSE,I think we can capture this cat without any harm to anyone.,12
ED MEECHAM,This is no time for wishful thinking.,7
WILLA AMBROSE,"I'm ordering you, Ed.",4
ED MEECHAM,"Yes, ma'am. Lead the way.",5
WILLA AMBROSE,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,How'd the tiger get all the way across town without being spotted?,12
MULDER,"I don't know, but we better find it before Meecham does.",11
WORKER 1,Hey! Shhh! It was just here.,6
ED MEECHAM,"It's all right, Willa. They don't all talk and draw pictures.",11
BOARD MEMBER,This last incident has left the Board with no choice but to withdraw all funding.,15
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, if that's your decision, there's nothing else I can say.",11
BOARD MEMBER,I'm sorry.,2
WILLA AMBROSE,I'm out of a job. They've cut off all funding. The animals are being shipped out to other zoos starting Monday.,21
MULDER,I'm sorry.,2
WILLA AMBROSE,It could not have happened at a worse time.,9
MULDER,You mean for Sophie?,4
WILLA AMBROSE,What I had going for me was my position here. Having a place for her. Have the results come in on the tiger?,23
MULDER,Agent Scully just finished the test. The tiger had been pregnant too.,12
WILLA AMBROSE,It's impossible. Theres no chance those animals could get pregnant. No way.,12
MULDER,What if they've been artificially inseminated?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,That's an extremely fine and complex process. I would have known.,11
MULDER,Unless it was done somewhere else.,6
WILLA AMBROSE,Where?,1
MULDER,What do you know about alien abduction?,7
WILLA AMBROSE,You're... you're... you're kidding me. You think these animals were taken aboard some space ship?,15
MULDER,"I don't know where they're being taken but there's obviously some problem getting them back. Due to what is probably an astrological variation, a trouble with the time-space continuum - these animals that are being taken from locked cages are being returned roughly two miles westsouthwest of the zoo.",48
WILLA AMBROSE,Aliens impregnating zoo animals?,4
MULDER,"Yes, and harvesting the embryos.",5
WILLA AMBROSE,Why?,1
MULDER,"Maybe their own Noah's ark? To preserve the DNA of these animals that we're depleting to extinction. Whatever it is, that's probably the reason why you've never had a successful birth at this facility.",34
WILLA AMBROSE,I think that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard.,9
MULDER,I understand that you might think it's ridiculous. Maybe you should ask Sophie.,13
WILLA AMBROSE,You think this is what she's so afraid of?,9
MULDER,"I believe she's pregnant, and she's afraid of them coming for her baby.",13
WILLA AMBROSE,"Sophie, come here. I want to ask you a question. It's okay, Sophie. Come here.",15
MULDER,What'd she say?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,"She says, ""man, woman - hurt."" She thinks you or your partner are going to hurt her or me. Sophie...... man, woman are here to help you. They want to know about Sophie's baby.",33
MULDER,Can I ask her a question?,6
WILLA AMBROSE,Yeah.,1
MULDER,Will you ask her if she wants to leave here?,10
WILLA AMBROSE,Sophie - do you want to leave here?,7
WILLA AMBROSE,"She says ""light afraid."" Sophie, what are you afraid of? Tell me.",12
MULDER,What did she say?,4
WILLA AMBROSE,"She said, ""baby go flying light.""",6
SCULLY,I just finished up in the infirmary. A sheriff's deputy came looking to serve you papers. I think it's about Sophie.,21
WILLA AMBROSE,What am I going to do?,6
MULDER,"Whatever you do, you can't leave Sophie here. Not if you want to protect her.",15
WILLA AMBROSE,I have nowhere else to take her.,7
DEPUTY,Excuse me. Willa Ambrose?,4
WILLA AMBROSE,Yes.,1
DEPUTY,I'm serving you with a court order to release a gorilla named Sophie into protective custody.,16
KYLE LANG,What are you doing here?,5
WILLA AMBROSE,"I've come to ask for your help, Kyle.",8
KYLE LANG,Help with what?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,Sophie. They've taken her into protective custody.,7
KYLE LANG,"Let her go, Willa.",4
WILLA AMBROSE,"They're putting her in an iron cage as we speak - without bars, without windows. It'll kill her.",17
KYLE LANG,"Sophie's been behind bars her entire life. Let her go home, Willa. She'll have the freedom she deserves.",18
WILLA AMBROSE,Freedom to what - be killed by poachers and have her hands cut off as souvenirs?,15
KYLE LANG,They've promised she'll be in a preserve.,7
WILLA AMBROSE,"She's mine, Kyle! I won't let her go! Please, come on. We can find a place for her here - a private reserve. You know people.",25
KYLE LANG,That's against everything I stand for.,6
WILLA AMBROSE,She's pregnant.,2
KYLE LANG,What?,1
WILLA AMBROSE,Sophie's pregnant.,2
KYLE LANG,"I don't believe you, Willa.",5
WILLA AMBROSE,It's true.,2
KYLE LANG,"Well what if she was? Is the baby gonna live out its life behind bars, too? Look, Willa, she doesn't belong to you. She's not your child. She belongs with other gorillas, not selling tickets for a zoo.",38
WILLA AMBROSE,You won't help me?,4
KYLE LANG,No.,1
SCULLY,You want to see something interesting?,6
MULDER,Where did you get this?,5
SCULLY,"I was looking for a pen to finish my report in Willa's office, and it was in her drawer.",19
MULDER,"It's a small world, after all.",6
WILLA AMBROSE,"It's okay, Sophie. It's okay, honey. Sophie, Sophie, Sophie - don't worry. I'm with you.",14
WILLA AMBROSE,I love you too.,4
KYLE LANG,Willa?,1
KYLE LANG,Willa? Are you there?,4
KYLE LANG,Willa? Where are you? Willa?,5
WILLA AMBROSE,"I told you, it happened exactly the way it did with the tiger. I heard the animals going crazy. I got out of bed to check on Sophie and she was gone. That's when I found Kyle.",37
SCULLY,Do you have any idea what he would have been doing at the zoo?,14
WILLA AMBROSE,No.,1
SCULLY,We have a witness who says that you visited Kyle's office yesterday. Is that true?,15
WILLA AMBROSE,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,For what purpose?,3
WILLA AMBROSE,"Basically, to tell him he'd won. That the zoo was being shut down, that Sophie was being taken into protective custody.",21
SCULLY,Did you ask him to help you take Sophie to prevent her from being taken from you?,17
WILLA AMBROSE,No. That would be against everything Kyle believed in.,9
SCULLY,"But he helped you to rescue her originally, isn't that correct? He had a connection to you and to this animal that went back several years.",26
WILLA AMBROSE,Whatever connection he and I had was over long ago.,10
SCULLY,But you asked him anyway... to help you.,8
WILLA AMBROSE,No.,1
SCULLY,"Then what was he doing here last night, and why did he give you this note?",16
WILLA AMBROSE,I don't know. I told you.,6
SCULLY,Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo?,9
WILLA AMBROSE,"If he did, it was probably late at night after he jumped over the fence like a good W.A.O. soldier. Anyway, why don't you ask Agent Mulder what he thinks happened? He seems to have a novel theory. Maybe it was alien abduction.",43
MULDER,"Scully, can I talk to you for a second?",9
SCULLY,You think she's telling the truth?,6
MULDER,Why do you say that?,5
SCULLY,"Well, Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance of the animal match the previous incidents.",14
MULDER,Yes.,1
SCULLY,And you've been pushing this alien abduction angle.,8
MULDER,"I still am, but in this case, Willa's reactions are all wrong.",12
SCULLY,You mean to losing Sophie?,5
MULDER,"I think she knows where Sophie is, and Kyle Lang died because he knows what she's capable of.",18
SCULLY,You think she killed him?,5
MULDER,I think she'd do anything to protect that animal.,9
SCULLY,Even wait atop a stack of crates for a former lover to walk underneath?,14
MULDER,"I think an examination of the body will give us a lot clearer picture of what happened last night. You do that, and I'll check out the warehouse.",28
SCULLY,Looks like you're in a hurry.,6
WILLA AMBROSE,"Well, there isn't much to hang around for, is there?",10
SCULLY,I'm afraid there is. I found evidence that Kyle died a wrongful death. He was hit with a cattle prod. There's gonna be an investigation so I have to read you your rights.,33
WILLA AMBROSE,It was an accident. Kyle surprised Ed. He wasn't supposed to be there.,13
SCULLY,Ed Meecham took Sophie?,4
WILLA AMBROSE,Yes. There was no one else to turn to.,9
SCULLY,"Where is she, Willa?",4
WILLA AMBROSE,Ed has her. She's in some building on the road to Boise.,12
MULDER,"Put it down, Ed. There's been enough violence, don't you think?",11
ED MEECHAM,I didn't kill Kyle Lang.,5
MULDER,Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.,9
ED MEECHAM,I was only doing what she paid me to do.,10
MULDER,"Where is the animal, Ed?",5
ED MEECHAM,Down the hall.,3
MULDER,Okay. You show me where - we're gonna go there together. Come on.,12
MULDER,What's she doing?,3
ED MEECHAM,She's throwing herself against the door. She's gone crazy.,9
MULDER,She's scared.,2
ED MEECHAM,"Yeah? Well, she's gonna kill herself.",6
MULDER,"Okay, Ed. Well, you're going to have to save her. Take your tranquilizer gun. I'll be right behind you.",19
ED MEECHAM,"I've only got one dart in this thing, so you got to get her out in the light.",18
MULDER,You see her?,3
ED MEECHAM,I think she's over in that corner over there.,9
MULDER,"Hey, Meecham!",2
MULDER,I'm not gonna hurt you.,5
SCULLY,Mulder? Mulder?,2
SCULLY,Sorry. Lie still.,3
MULDER,Where's Sophie?,2
SCULLY,Lie down. Can we get a paramedic in here?,9
POLICEMAN,"Yes, ma'am.",2
MULDER,Meecham.,1
SCULLY,Ed Meecham's been arrested. We picked him up on the way to Boise. That's how we found you here.,19
MULDER,They took Sophie.,3
SCULLY,Who did?,2
MULDER,Where's Willa?,2
SCULLY,She's outside. She's going in to make a statement about Kyle Lang.,12
