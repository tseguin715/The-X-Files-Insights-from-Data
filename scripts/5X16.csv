VOICE,Where’s the money! You trying to rip me off?,9
MAN,Huh?,1
VOICE,You trying to rip me off?!,6
POLICE RADIO,"Dispatch, this is unit seven investigating a reported disturbance at 214 Prospect avenue, over.",14
DISPATCH,Copy that ??,2
JIMMY THE COP,Jeez.....,1
JIMMY THE COP,Police! Don’t move! Keep ‘em in the air.,8
KEITH THE COP,"Cuff her, Jimmy.",3
JIMMY THE COP,"Damn, she’s got blood all over her. Hey Keith. I think you might want to check this out. I think she’s blind.",22
SCULLY,The deceased is Paco Ordonez aka Little Monster. Street dealer. Liked to use grade school kids as couriers. Out on bail for possession with intent. Two-time loser looking at life.,30
MULDER,I have the same pair of pants. Who exterminated him?,10
PENNOCK,That’s a subject of some debate.,6
SCULLY,The killer carved a single C-shaped cut up through the right kidney. Fatal blood loss came in under 30 seconds.,20
MULDER,"I’m going to assume the killer knew what he was doing and that ""C"" wasn’t one of his initials?",19
PENNOCK,"Your assumptions are correct. Only the killer isn’t a he. Marty Glenn -- 28. We found her at the scene doing a formula 409. Under normal circumstances, my department would have her dead to rights. There’s just one little snag.",39
MULDER,She’s been blind since birth.,5
PENNOCK,"Now before your heart goes out to her, check out her rap sheet.",13
MULDER,"""Fraud... petty theft.... aggravated assault.""",5
PENNOCK,Believe me. She’s a real piece of work.,8
SCULLY,"Her juvenile records are sealed, but Detective Pennock has it on authority that two of them were drug busts – possession, and possession with intent.",25
MULDER,"So, what, you think that uh, she caught Little Monster trying to snatch the pebble from her hand?",18
PENNOCK,Nothing else makes sense.,4
MULDER,Including how a blind girl could get the drop on an ex-con and bleed him out with surgical precision.,19
SCULLY,"Ms. Glenn took a $60 cab ride alone straight to the motel. The cabbie instructed her to room 10, which she asked for specifically, and then told him to get lost. 30 minutes later, dead heroin dealer.",37
MULDER,"All right, so you really believe that she did this? You just don’t know how.",15
PENNOCK,"Well, I’ve got a theory, if you want to hear it.",11
MULDER,nan,1
PENNOCK,"I think she’s got some kind of .. sixth sense, lets her see in the dark... like a bat or something. I got 48 hours to convince the DA or wait till she kills somebody else.",35
MULDER,Well how soon can I meet her?,7
MARTY,Oh... it’s you.,3
PENNOCK,See what I mean?,4
MARTY,It’s not magic. It’s your crappy cologne. Who’s that with you?,11
MULDER,Special Agent Mulder.,3
MARTY,And the lady?,3
SCULLY,"Uh, Special Agent Scully. We’d like to ask you some questions, Marty.",12
MARTY,"You must be having trouble with your case, Detective.",9
PENNOCK,Fine. Suit yourself.,3
MARTY,What are you staring at?,5
MULDER,An innocent woman. I hope.,5
MARTY,"So, I’m all ears.",4
SCULLY,I’m curious why you’ve refused your right to an attorney.,10
MARTY,"Unless you’re going to charge me, I don’t plan on needing one.",12
SCULLY,"Well, you could be charged right now .. for the fact that you’ve given no compelling reason why you were in that motel room. What were you doing there, Marty?",29
MARTY,Putting mints on the pillows.,5
SCULLY,"The cabbie has given a statement that you asked specifically for room 10, which would put you at the murder scene right about the time of death.",27
MARTY,Is that a crime?,4
SCULLY,If you were involved in any way.,7
MARTY,"You mean like, an eyewitness?",5
SCULLY,Did you intend to buy drugs from Paco Ordonez?,9
MARTY,nan,1
SCULLY,Did you kill him?,4
MARTY,"Eh, maybe it was just his time to go. I mean, other than the stab wound, did you check his cholesterol level or anything?",24
MULDER,How did you know there was just one stab wound?,10
MARTY,Did I say that?,4
MULDER,Mmm hmm.,2
MARTY,"I guessed. You know what the problem is? You’ve got no murder weapon. And I bet that’s driving Stinky back there crazy. Isn’t it, Stinky! Why is he hiding? It’s not like I can see him. You know what I did with it, Detective? I fed it to my seeing eye dog.",52
MULDER,"I’m curious, Marty.",3
MARTY,"Yeah, about what?",3
MULDER,"If you didn’t kill him, why you were at the crime scene cleaning up and doing such a piss poor job of it.",23
MARTY,nan,1
MULDER,"Why don’t we just stop playing games here, okay? I mean you probably don’t know a feather duster from a duck’s ass, do you? I mean it’s ridiculous. You’re a blind woman, for God’s sake. So why don’t you just tell us who did kill Paco Ordonez, and Agent Scully and I can go arrest him, and you can go home and work on your angry-young-blind-girl comedy routine.",68
MARTY,nan,1
MULDER,Or we can just... stay here and entertain each other for the next 48 hours.,15
MARTY,Go to hell.,3
PENNOCK,See what I mean? Put a knife in that hand....,10
MULDER,All I see is a woman who’s adapted to her impairment admirably. She’s honed all her other senses around her blindness.,21
PENNOCK,She’s taunting you.,3
MULDER,"I dunno I - I think she just wants us to think she’s strong, independent. It’s important to her.",18
PENNOCK,She wants us to know she did it.,8
MULDER,I don’t think she did do it.,7
PENNOCK,"Then why won’t she help us? It’s been my experience that innocent people don’t act like that, Agent Mulder.",19
SCULLY,"She wouldn’t explain her presence in the crime scene, and she avoided all discussion about the murder weapon.",18
PENNOCK,She knew there was only one stab wound. You caught that yourself.,12
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"Detective, did you snake all of the plumbing in the bathroom?",11
PENNOCK,I turned that place upside down and inside out.,9
SCULLY,"Well, if we find the weapon with her fingerprints on it, she’s as good as convicted. Short of that, she's gonna walk.",22
PENNOCK,"Well, maybe I can get you to come out to the crime scene one last time.",16
SCULLY,Okay.,1
MULDER,You go ahead. I want - I want to – I want to investigate something.,14
EXAMINER,"I’m going to ask you a series of questions. Respond only with a ""yes"""" or ""no."" Do not judge the content of the question, simply answer truthfully. Is your full name Martelle Francis Glenn?",34
MARTY,Yeah.,1
EXAMINER,Are you a resident of the State of Delaware?,9
MARTY,"Let’s just cut through the bull, or I’m going to decide not to cooperate at all.",16
MULDER,"All right, let's, uh, get to it.",7
EXAMINER,I need to establish a baseline.,6
MARTY,"I’m a resident of the State of Delaware, okay? Let’s move on.",12
EXAMINER,Is it your intent to lie during the course of this examination?,12
MARTY,I’m sure you’ll tell me if it is.,8
EXAMINER,"Did you stab Paco Ordonez, also known as Little Monster?",10
MARTY,Nope.,1
EXAMINER,Did you plan or arrange the murder of Paco Ordonez?,10
MARTY,No.,1
EXAMINER,Have you ever met Paco Ordonez?,6
MARTY,No.,1
EXAMINER,Would you ever have occasion to see Paco Ordonez or know him in any other way? Strike that. Have you ever had occasion to interact with Paco Ordonez or know him in any other way?,35
MARTY,No.,1
EXAMINER,Were you present during the murder of Paco Ordonez?,9
MARTY,No. EXAMINER hesitates.),3
MARTY,Why don’t you just ask me yourself?,7
MULDER,Did you see the murder?,5
MULDER,Did you see the murder?,5
MARTY,I don’t see anything.,4
EXAMINER,"Yes or no, only please.",5
MARTY,Then the answer is no.,5
PENNOCK,"No blood trails leading out of the bathroom, windows are painted shut, and as you can see, not a lot of places she could have stashed it.",27
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,She’s lying.,2
SCULLY,About what?,2
MULDER,"She knew Paco Ordonez, but I don’t think she murdered him.",11
SCULLY,How do you know that she knew him?,8
MULDER,Well I made her take a polygraph test. She passed on every question except one – did she *see* the murder.,21
SCULLY,Would you like me to remind you why polygraphs are inadmissible in court?,13
MULDER,"No, she cracked, Scully. She was lying. I’m sure of it.",11
SCULLY,"Well, maybe she was, Mulder, but don’t make me state the obvious. She didn’t see anything.",16
MULDER,Not with her eyes.,4
SCULLY,"Well, how else did she see? Bat vision?",8
MULDER,I don’t know.,3
SCULLY,"Well, Mulder, when you figure it out, give me a call.",11
SCULLY,Detective Pennock.,2
WOMAN,"No thanks, I’m not looking for any company. Hey, listen, buddy! I said get your hands off of -",18
MARTY,"Somebody, I need a phone! I get to call a lawyer, somebody, I need a phone!",16
MARTY,"I got it. You know, I’m sure the ACLU is going to be very interested in how you violated a blind woman’s rights by eavesdropping on her private phone call.",30
GUARD,nan,1
MARTY,Same to you.,3
BARTENDER,"Blarney Stone. Uh, let’s see. Guy hitting on a redhead at the end of the bar?",16
WOMAN,"I told you, stop it!",5
BARTENDER,"Yeah, we got somebody matching that description.",7
BARTENDER,It’s for you.,3
OLDER MAN,Yeah?,1
MARTY,Leave her alone.,3
OLDER MAN,Who is this?,3
MARTY,You just leave her alone. I’m watching you.,8
MARTY,Let me guess... Your killer is OJ Simpson.,8
SCULLY,They were found at the crime scene with blood all over them. We believe they were worn by Paco Ordonez’s killer.,21
MARTY,You’re good.,2
PENNOCK,We think they belong to you.,6
MARTY,"Well, they don’t.",3
PENNOCK,"Well, how ‘bout you try one on for us.",9
MARTY,And put my prints all over them?,7
SCULLY,"Your prints are already all over them, Marty.",8
PENNOCK,Hold still.,2
MARTY,"Are you happy, Detective?",4
PENNOCK,Looks to me like it fits.,6
MARTY,"Somewhere, Marcia Clark weeps. But you still haven’t got a weapon.",11
PENNOCK,"Ah, it’s just a matter of time.",7
MARTY,But you haven’t got time.,5
SCULLY,Hope you saw what just happened in there.,8
MULDER,"Even if the gloves do fit, you can still acquit.",10
SCULLY,"I think it’s arrogance, Mulder. I think it’s the same reason why she agreed to take the polygraph test. She knows that the prejudices in this case are all in her favor.",32
MULDER,"I don’t think it’s that simple. Look at this. She lives in poverty, but she’s never taken advantage of the disability benefits that are available to her.",27
(LIST OF BENEFITS,"Social Security, General Disability, Blind Disability, Public Assistance, Unemployed Compensation, Supplemental Security Income, Insurance Benefits -- all checked ""no."" ) Never once. It’s poison to her. The - the mere suggestion that she’s anything other than a whole or complete person is offensive to her. It’s not arrogance, it’s pride.",47
SCULLY,"So, you think that it was pride that made her ditch the bloody gloves? Her prints were all over them, Mulder. Why would she do that.",26
MULDER,I have no idea. I don’t –,7
SCULLY,"Okay, so - so by your reasoning, the killer took off with the murder weapon, but not the gloves leaving Marty to come in, go straight to the gloves, and hide them in the one place that nobody would easily think to find them.",43
MULDER,"I think that’s the most accurate scenario available to us, right now.",12
SCULLY,"Well, wait a minute. Maybe it’s much simpler than that.",10
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"What if she’s not really blind? I mean, she hasn’t applied for any of her - her disability benefits. Maybe that’s because she knows that she couldn’t pass the medical screening.",30
MULDER,You think she’s faking it?,5
SCULLY,"No, no. But - but possibly it’s a - a conversion disorder, or a - a form of blindsight. A - a split consciousness whereby a person has a certain level of visual ability but they’re not aware that they’re actually seeing. It’s worth checking out.",42
DEALER,"Yo, man, moving Little Monster’s ""H"" ain’t gonna be easy. See, a lot of people respected him, you know.",19
OLDER MAN,"You buying or not? If you’re not buying, I can go to somebody else.",14
DEALER,No you cain’t. But I’m feelin’ magnanimous. Swing by in a couple of hours. Maybe we can do some business.,20
OLDER MAN,"Good. Yeah, there’s something I’ve got to look into first. When I’m done, I’ll be in touch.",17
DOCTOR,"Eyes wide, please, Marty. Good. Try not to move around too much. Are you aware of any sensation at all?",20
MARTY,Ahh! It’s a miracle!,4
DOCTOR,"All right , Marty. Now we’re going to introduce some optical stimuli. Try not to blink. Just relax for a moment. I’m not getting anything. I don’t think there’s any activity in either the visual cortex or the superior colliculus.",39
SCULLY,There’s no way that she could fool the machine?,9
DOCTOR,We’re talking about wholly involuntary physical responses. I wasn’t getting any reading.,12
MULDER,Then what is that?,4
MAN’S VOICE,Where is she?,3
MULDER,"What is it, Marty? What do you see?",8
PENNOCK,Agents? This is Daniel Costa from the DA’s office.,9
COSTA,So what did we find? I hear the girl can actually see with some limited ability?,16
MULDER,"No. No, according to her examiner, she is completely without sight or any kind of light sensitivity.",17
SCULLY,But she is still our best and only suspect.,9
COSTA,You said we were making progress.,6
PENNOCK,We are.,2
COSTA,"Well, I’m not going to try to indict a blind girl on some lousy prints.",15
MULDER,"She doesn’t exactly fit the definition ""blind girl.""",8
COSTA,"Come on, folks. Either she is or she isn’t.",9
PENNOCK,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,"Well, there is evidence of some kind of neurological activity which caused her pupils to dilate.",16
PENNOCK,From what?,2
MULDER,"To me, it indicates some reaction to stimuli. Some kind physical response to images in her mind’s eye.",18
COSTA,How’s that make her the killer?,6
MULDER,I didn’t say it did.,5
COSTA,Kick her loose.,3
PENNOCK,Danny...,1
COSTA,"I got no case, Penn.",5
PENNOCK,I don’t believe this.,4
COSTA,I’m not trying her. Not without a murder weapon. Kick her loose.,12
PENNOCK,Wonderful. Thanks.,2
MARTY,These better still be twenties.,5
OFFICER,"No, I replaced them with fifties since you’re so damn sweet.",11
SCULLY,Want to hear the latest?,5
MULDER,Yes.,1
SCULLY,"Detective Pennock ran the gloves for blood typing and found two different samples, one type matching Marty Glenn’s.",18
MULDER,"Well, she was examined. There were no cuts or wounds on her.",12
SCULLY,"Yeah, well, all the same I’m going to hand deliver them to the lab in Washington, expedite a PCR to see if she’s a match. MULDER; Look at her. Do you really think she’s capable?",35
SCULLY,I’ll let you know as soon as I get the tests back.,12
OLDER MAN,Who called me last night? Who’s watching me?,8
WOMAN,What?! I... I don’t know what you’re talking about.,9
OLDER MAN,You a cop? You wearing a wire?,7
WOMAN,No! I’m not a cop!,5
WOMAN,Let me go!,3
MARTY,"I need to get to Spring Street. Which way is Spring Street? Somebody, answer me!",15
NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN,Four blocks to the left.,5
WOMAN,Please! Please!!,2
WOMAN,No! Don’t kill me! No! No! No! No!,8
MARTY,Where?,1
NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN,Here. Here - here. There’s an alley here. Right here.,9
MARTY,Thanks. Leave me alone.,4
MARTY,"Excuse me. Excuse me, somebody.",5
OFFICER,Yeah?,1
MARTY,I killed them. I killed them both.,7
MULDER,I read your *confession*. Detective Pennock is typing it up as we speak for you to sign.,17
MARTY,I’ll sign it.,3
MULDER,You’ll make him a very happy man.,7
MARTY,Can’t have everything.,3
MULDER,"Just for me, I’m a little puzzled by this sudden change of heart.",13
MARTY,"Please, too much charity of heart and I want to puke.",11
MULDER,I - I just... why kill *them*. Paco Ordonez... Susan Forester? Did you even know that was her name? Susan Forester. She was 30 years old. Native of Wilmington. She waitressed part-time. She lived alone with her two cats...,38
MARTY,Shut up! Why are you doing this? I - I.... I’ve given you people everything you want.,16
MULDER,"I *like* you, Marty. I *admire* you. And I don’t want to see you confess to crimes you didn’t commit.",20
MARTY,You just feel sorry for me.,6
MULDER,"No, I don’t. Not the way you think I do.",10
MARTY,Read the confession. I got it all perfect. Every detail. How could I do that if I’m innocent?,18
MULDER,"I believe you witnessed both murders. You - you saw them, somehow. But you were way ‘cross town when they happened. You were a $60 cab ride away.",27
MARTY,You’re crazy.,2
MULDER,"I think you tried to stop them. You tried to, but you didn’t get there in time.",17
MARTY,I don’t have to talk to you anymore.,8
MULDER,"Marty, whoever did this, they’re going to kill again. And you *can* help stop that.",15
MARTY,"I can’t stop anything. I don’t have to talk to you anymore, period. Officer! We’re done!",16
MULDER,"Who’s worth pleading guilty for, Marty?",6
MARTY,"Officer, we’re done!",3
MULDER,You didn’t do it. And I’m not going to let this happen. Do you hear me? Marty?,17
DEALER,"Sorry, man. Deal’s off.",4
OLDER MAN,"What do you mean ""deal’s off?"" You can’t back out.",10
DEALER,"Hey, look it here, brother, I do what I got to do to stay on the download and you shinin’ too much light on me.",25
OLDER MAN,What are you talking about?,5
DEALER,"Somebody’s gunning for you, man. And I ain’t gettin’ in the middle of it.",14
OLDER MAN,Who? Who’s gunnin’ for me?,5
DEALER,Some old girlfriend of yours called last night and told me I should steer clear.,15
OLDER MAN,She called you?,3
DEALER,"Yeah, said she was passing the word.",7
OLDER MAN,"Listen to me. Listen, man. She’s nobody, huh? She knows nothing.",11
DEALER,"Yeah, right.",2
OLDER,"MAN: You and me, man, we’re still cool. Trust me.",10
DEALER,"Well, if she don’t know anything, how’d she get this number?",11
OLDER MAN,Listen to me. I got nowhere else to take this stuff.,11
DEALER,That’s not my problem. Just don’t you call here again.,10
"27, 1970, 8","55 pm, address - 555 Hol...? Body found at 1044 Pend..? Lying face down on the floor. Single stab wound right kidney."" PENNOCK enters.)",23
PENNOCK,"Well, I appreciate your help here, such at it was, but I’d say we’re doing all right. She just signed her confession.",22
MULDER,Congratulations.,1
PENNOCK,"I don’t feel as good as you might think, you know.",11
MULDER,"Well, all you’ve got is a signature. No lawyer’s going to let her go down based on that.",18
PENNOCK,I’m aware of that.,4
MULDER,"Doesn’t it bother you, Detective, that you still have no clear motive?",12
PENNOCK,Well she just now gave us that. Drugs. Just like I thought. She even told us where to find them.,20
PENNOCK,I’d say this is gonna make it a pretty short trial.,11
MULDER,"Well, if you think about it, Detective, it actually proves nothing.",11
PENNOCK,"There it is, just like she said.",7
MULDER,Just like she *described.*,4
PENNOCK,"You know, the thing I find most surprising about this case is you. You are one skeptical guy, Agent Mulder.",20
MULDER,Skeptical?!,1
PENNOCK,"Oh, yeah.",2
MULDER,"I’ve been called a lot of things. Skeptical, however, is not one.",12
PENNOCK,"Well, whatever.",2
MULDER,Skeptical.,1
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"I’ve got the PCR results on the two blood types from the gloves. Neither was Marty’s. You were right, Mulder. She didn’t do it.",24
MULDER,"Well, I know that, and you know that, and so does whoever Marty’s protecting, but Pennock is salivating right now. What we have to do is convince Marty. I got an idea. I’ll get back to you.",37
MARTY,What do you want now?,5
MULDER,"I know who you’re protecting, Marty. And I think I know why. You’re protecting the man who murdered your mother.",20
MARTY,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,7
MULDER,I read the original police report from 1970. Your mother died from a single stab wound to the right kidney -- as did Paco Ordonez and Susan Forester. Dead at the hands of an unknown assailant.,35
MARTY,I never knew my mother.,5
MULDER,No. I know. But for once you were there when it happened. She was pregnant with you at the time. She died on the operating table as doctors were trying to save her. You were born... just barely. But the interruption in blood flow you suffered most likely caused your blindness.,51
MARTY,What does that have to do with anything?,8
MULDER,I think that during that time... as you lost one sense... you gained another. That somehow... a connection was formed between you and your mother’s killer.,26
MARTY,What connection?,2
MULDER,"You see through his eyes. You always have. You don’t want to, you just do. And because of that you feel responsible for his actions, but you’re not. And you’re sitting here in prison for crimes you didn’t commit. It isn’t going to accomplish anything, Marty.",46
PENNOCK,"Excuse me, Agent Mulder. She’s being transferred now.",8
MULDER,"There’s absolutely no point to you doing this, Marty. We’re going to find him with or without your help.",19
MARTY,I’m sorry.,2
MULDER,"Hi, Marty.",2
MARTY,What’s going on?,3
MULDER,Detective Pennock is with the warden right now arranging for your release.,12
MARTY,Ah! What?,2
MULDER,The charges against you are being dropped. You’re no longer a suspect in this case.,15
MARTY,How can they do that?! I confessed.,7
MULDER,"Yeah, well, confession is worthless if it’s a lie, and yours was a lie.",14
MARTY,What have you been telling them?,6
MULDER,"Just that you’re innocent, which is something they would have found out on their own anyway. The locker you sent us to? It had prints on it, but they weren’t yours.",31
MARTY,I was careful.,3
MULDER,"Yeah, well, somebody else wasn’t so careful. Charles Wesley Gotts, an ex-con. Convicted in 1970 of aggravated assault. He was paroled three weeks ago and he’s been missing ever since.",30
MARTY,Never heard of him.,4
MULDER,"I happen to believe that, Marty. The PCR tests confirmed that it was his blood on the glove. The tests confirmed something else, Marty. He’s your father. That was the connection.",31
MARTY,Hmm.,1
PENNOCK,"Okay, we’re all set. That is, if everything’s taken care of on this end.",14
MARTY,What’s he talking about?,4
MULDER,"Detective Pennock has agreed to not pursue aiding and abetting charges if you agree to help us... if you agree to help us find him. We need your help, Marty. You can end it now.",35
MARTY,I can end this.,4
MULDER,I’m sure that’s what you’ve always wanted.,7
MARTY,"I never wanted to spend my life in a place like this. I had no choice. Hmm. If I help you, will you protect me until he’s caught?",28
PENNOCK,I will personally guarantee your safety.,6
MARTY,Hmmm. Take me home.,4
VOICE ON POLICE RADIO,Moving into position at the back exit.,7
MULDER,"All right, stand by.",4
VOICE ON POLICE RADIO,Copy that.,2
MULDER,Just in time for the surprise party.,7
SCULLY,She told you he’d be in there?,7
MULDER,"Yeah, she described this place perfectly, right down to the matchbooks.",11
SCULLY,What made her decide to cooperate? MULDER; She wants to stop him.,12
SCULLY,"All of a sudden? I mean, if she’s so anxious to stop him, why didn’t she tell us his name before now?",22
MULDER,She didn’t know his name. They’ve never met. He’s been in prison her entire life.,15
SCULLY,"Well, yet, according to you, she’s been seeing through his eyes the whole time.",14
MULDER,I - I don’t think she was sure exactly what she was seeing but it was more like a - a constant image in her mind that she learned to live with over time. Up until three weeks ago.,37
SCULLY,When the murders started.,4
MULDER,He was paroled and everything changed.,6
SCULLY,"Well, if all this is true, let's go get him. Mulder?",11
MULDER,"Everything’s changed for her, Scully. I don’t think we’re going to find him in there.",15
PENNOCK,Need some help over there?,5
MARTY,Nope.,1
PENNOCK,"Should’ve known. Now you know, you don’t have to pack everything you own. I promise you, you’re not going to be in protective custody that long.",26
MARTY,"It’s too late for that, anyway.",6
PENNOCK,Why is that?,3
MARTY,Gotts is already here.,4
PENNOCK,What are you talking about?,5
MARTY,He’s been keeping tabs on me for about a day. Now he knows where I live. He’s reading the names on the mailboxes right now.,25
PENNOCK,What? How could you know........,5
SCULLY,How did you know he wouldn’t be in there?,9
MULDER,She doesn’t want us to get him. She misdirected us on purpose.,12
SCULLY,She’s still protecting him?,4
MULDER,"No, she’s not. She never was. Pennock’s not picking up.",10
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,"It’s not him she’s been protecting. If he goes back to prison, so does she. Until now, she’s never had a choice.",22
MARTY,I hate the way you see me.,7
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
PENNOCK,She did this one. Trust me.,6
MARTY,"Not much to look at, is it? At least, that’s what they tell me. You were at the sentencing, Agent Mulder.",21
MULDER,Is it my cologne?,4
MARTY,"No, I just knew you’d be there.",7
MULDER,"Marty, let me speak to the judge on your behalf.",10
MARTY,No.,1
MULDER,We found where he’d been staying. It was a motel not far from where Paco Ordonez had been murdered.,19
MARTY,"And before that, Atlantic City. Hmmm. I’d never seen the ocean before. And now when I close my eyes, or even when I open them, that’s all I see.",29
MULDER,"Well, you’re lucky he wasn’t a fan of the Ice Capades.",11
GUARD OVER INTERCOM,Lights out.,2
