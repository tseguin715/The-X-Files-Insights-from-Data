YOUNG MAN,"Oh, my God! That was... that was incredible. I mean it. You don't believe me. Can you hear me? Hey, I... I don't even know your name.",27
HORTON,"New York businessman calls his wife to say good night, then goes out and picks up some chippy. He brings her back here for sex. Beyond that, well, nothing makes a whole lot of sense.",35
SCULLY,How's that?,2
HORTON,Security monitor records the victim entering the room with midnight.,10
SCULLY,Couldn't she just have changed clothes?,6
HORTON,"Thought of that. Male is definitely a different person - short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier. The video never recorded his entry, nor the chippy ever leaving.",28
SCULLY,"Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?",19
HORTON,Guy blew an artery. Must have been some roll in the hay.,12
SCULLY,Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex with a perfect stranger. Any sign of robbery?,19
HORTON,"The male exited wearing the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase. The wallet's gone.",13
SCULLY,"You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the first place.",15
HORTON,Really? Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo requesting any case involving this exact COD. I assumed it was...,20
MULDER,Thanks for the call.,4
MULDER,"Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston. In each case, the victim dies in the throes of passion. Two women and three men, including the last one.",32
SCULLY,"All young, healthy adults.",4
MULDER,All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.,7
SCULLY,You think there's a new drug on the streets?,9
MULDER,"The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.",16
SCULLY,"The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants?",8
MULDER,"Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature, strong enough to product anaphylactic shock or a coronary.",22
SCULLY,So you think somebody is synthesizing them?,7
MULDER,"It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations and hold on to your hat, Scully, 'cause you're gonna love this. The pheromones we're talking about - they contain human DNA.",30
SCULLY,"Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones. So how can that be?",17
MULDER,"I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking aphrodysiac. He's the ultimate sex magnet.",19
SCULLY,He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.,20
MULDER,I know. That is a puzzle.,6
SCULLY,"So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, weight, sex. Unarmed but extremely attractive.",16
MULDER,"It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths matching this MO in the last six weeks - in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and here in Washington.",26
SCULLY,The killer's moving south.,4
MULDER,"There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms. A 32 year-old UMW labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts, home to a sect of religious isolationists called 'The Kindred'.",46
SCULLY,"Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, any modern amenities, a lot like the Amish.",16
MULDER,The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.,18
SCULLY,What's so weird about that?,5
MULDER,The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. It's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's sides.,27
SCULLY,"Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?",16
MULDER,"Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails.",17
WOMAN,Hi.,1
MULDER,"Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, I'm Agent Mulder.",11
SCULLY,We're investigating a possible murder.,5
WOMAN,"Oh, there aren't many killings around here.",7
MULDER,"What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?",15
MAN,"Yeah, some folks say it's because they're doing ceremonies up there. Voodoo or something. I've got nothing against them, myself. They bring in the tourists.",25
SCULLY,Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?,8
MAN,"Oh, those. Those are from back in the thirties.",9
MULDER,What about the missing ones?,5
MAN,I'm having them reframed. They're right here under the counter.,10
MULDER,Can I take a look at them?,7
MAN,Sure.,1
MULDER,How would I get up to see them?,8
MAN,"Oh, they don't like strangers up there much. Road's in pretty rough shape. That's Steveston.",15
MAN,That's them now. They usually shop at the feed store.,10
MULDER,Excuse me. Ladies? I think I'm gonna go inside. You need anything from the feed store?,16
SCULLY,Hi.,1
SCULLY,She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever thrown a shoe? What's her name?,16
BROTHER ANDREW,Alice.,1
SCULLY,That's sweet. Did you name her?,6
BROTHER ANDREW,We named her all together. I'm not allowed to talk outside.,11
SCULLY,That's all right. I'm Dana Scully. I don't mean you any harm.,12
KINDRED MAN,Brother Andrew.,2
MULDER,"Scully, what are you doing?",5
SCULLY,I was just talking...,4
MULDER,You all right?,3
SCULLY,"Yeah, I think so.",4
MULDER,You want to sit down?,5
MULDER,Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them?,10
SCULLY,"There's something up there, Mulder.",5
MULDER,"Oh, I've been saying that for years.",7
MULDER,"Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk.",11
SCULLY,After you.,2
MULDER,Now... this... that's west.,4
SCULLY,What does the map say?,5
MULDER,That we should be there already.,6
SCULLY,"Mulder, look.",2
SCULLY,We're FBI agents. Federal police.,5
MULDER,"I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to investigate a murder.",13
SCULLY,"I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.",14
BROTHER OAKLEY,"Your weapons are forbidden here. We can outlast you at this spot. You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our Council. You'll have them again, as you leave.",33
MULDER,We can't do that.,4
SISTER ABIGAIL,"Please. I'm Sister Abby. This is Brother Oakley. We're all saddened by what has happened in your world, but it does not concern us. Up here, no one kills another - ever.",31
SCULLY,We just want to have a few questions answered.,9
SISTER ABIGAIL,"It is your weapons that are unwelcome here, not you. Come and pray with us, be one of us, and you'll see that we harm no one. Please relinquish your weapons. Please.",32
SISTER ABIGAIL,Now there is no reason to be afraid.,8
BROTHER OAKLEY,Come. Sit.,2
SISTER ABIGAIL,Let us pray as one. We who are separate give thanks for our alloted time in this world. We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided.,33
ALL,Amen.,1
SISTER ABIGAIL,"We pray for the day of the coming, the moment of our release.",13
ALL,Amen.,1
SISTER ABIGAIL,Let us eat.,3
MULDER,I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. We're looking for someone we believe may have come from here.,21
SCULLY,We have pictures.,3
SISTER ABIGAIL,We do not allow pictures.,5
SCULLY,"A crime has been committed. We have certain questions that we need answered, if you'll forgive us.",17
BROTHER ANDREW,What are these pictures?,4
SCULLY,Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder.,15
BROTHER ANDREW,Where was this crime committed?,5
SCULLY,"In a hotel in Washington, DC.",6
MULDER,"If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe you can identify the individual.",18
BROTHER ANDREW,How much violence has this person caused in your world?,10
MULDER,"Five murders, so far.",4
SCULLY,"And may kill again, which is why we need your help.",11
MULDER,Has anyone left here recently?,5
BROTHER WILTON,Your world does not interest us. We have no need for your violence or your questions. I've said what is needed. They have no right to be here at this time.,31
SISTER ABIGAIL,"Brother Wilton, stand. Before we can accept any man's person, we must accept our own. And I ask, who can stand in your sight when once you are angry. I am ashamed to lift up my face, and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time. Make atonements for this wrath, Brother Wilton.",54
MULDER,That's all right. We didn't take any offense.,8
BROTHER ANDREW,"Anger, as violence, is not tolerated. Our brother must be admonished.",11
SCULLY,He can't breathe.,3
SISTER ABIGAIL,He does not need your help.,6
SCULLY,He's choking to death!,4
SISTER ABIGAIL,Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall.,7
SISTER ABIGAIL,We did not invite you here to interfere.,8
BROTHER ANDREW,We take care of our own.,6
MARTY (MALE),Would you like to dance?,5
BLONDE WOMAN,"Not right now. Look, I'm really not interested, OK?",9
MARTY (MALE),Just one dance?,3
BLONDE WOMAN,Hi.,1
MARTY (MALE),One dance?,2
BROTHER WILTON,It's a mile to your car. Stay in the path.,10
MULDER,Thanks for your cooperation.,4
MULDER,The Addams family finds religion.,5
SCULLY,Take me back to the 20th century.,7
MULDER,"You believe all that back there, Scully?",7
SCULLY,Believe all what?,3
MULDER,"All that ""we take care of our own"" business?",9
SCULLY,"Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.",19
MULDER,I think it was all an elaborate act.,8
SCULLY,What? The choking?,3
MULDER,"No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. These people know something, Scully. You can see it in their eyes - the way they look at one another.",28
SCULLY,Do you think they know who the murderer is?,9
MULDER,"Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours? And that outburst at the table was right on cue. Somehow, they got us to answer their questions. Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?",42
SCULLY,"I know, that was odd.",5
MULDER,"You want to know what was really odd? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today, the ones from the thirties? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight.",40
SCULLY,These people have probably been intermarrying for years.,8
MULDER,Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be.,14
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
MULDER,I'm going to go back for a little look-see.,9
MULDER,Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that?,10
SCULLY,Uh-huh.,1
SCULLY,What do you think?,4
MULDER,I think I want to see what's in that cellar.,10
BROTHER ANDREW,Come with me. I can give you information.,8
BROTHER ANDREW,I know who did it.,5
SCULLY,The murders?,2
BROTHER ANDREW,You've heard our prayers. You've seen how we live our beliefs. I want you to find this killer. I want you to find him for me. He was my best friend.,31
SCULLY,What's his name?,3
BROTHER ANDREW,Brother Martin. I called him Marty.,6
BROTHER ANDREW,Marty was different.,3
SCULLY,"What do you mean, different?",5
BROTHER ANDREW,How does he kill?,4
SCULLY,We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.,11
BROTHER ANDREW,"He poisons them, doesn't he?",5
SCULLY,"Maybe, how do you know that?",6
BROTHER ANDREW,I need to show you something... something about Marty.,9
BROTHER ANDREW,We found them out on route 44. We were wandering. Marty and I used to do that - explore the edges of our world. Someone must have left them for garbage. They are garbage.,33
SCULLY,Why did you keep them?,5
BROTHER ANDREW,"It was Martin who kept them. Some of what I saw in the magazines... some of it was beautiful, but most of it I didn't like. It was garish. But Martin - Marty - he couldn't get enough. He liked even the paper it was printed on - slick. Marty was captured by your world. He left us to become one of you.",60
KINDRED MAN #1,Brother Wilton! The woman has returned.,6
BROTHER WILTON,Where is she?,3
KINDRED MAN #1,"With Andrew, in the main house.",6
BROTHER WILTON,What about the other one?,5
KINDRED MAN #1,He's missing.,2
BROTHER WILTON,Come.,1
SCULLY,You said Marty was different.,5
BROTHER ANDREW,Yes.,1
SCULLY,How? How did he kill his victims?,7
BROTHER ANDREW,I could be banished.,4
SCULLY,Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?,13
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
MULDER,Scully...,1
BROTHER ANDREW,Marty is different. We're all different.,6
SCULLY,Oh... oh.,2
MULDER,Scully?,1
MULDER,Get off of her!,4
SISTER ABIGAIL,I asked you not to interfere.,6
MULDER,What the hell were you doing back there?,8
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MULDER,You don't know?,3
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,You all right?,3
MICHAEL,"I wasn't ignoring you. No. Of course I saw you, I just didn't recognize you, that's all. Excuse me, I'm having a conversation...",23
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
MULDER,How you feeling?,3
SCULLY,"Better... a little embarrassed, actually.",5
MULDER,Why? You don't remember any of it.,7
SCULLY,It's like I don't remember...,5
MULDER,Why didn't you get out of there before he...,9
SCULLY,Because he told me he knew who the killer was.,10
MULDER,How did you know he wasn't the killer?,8
SCULLY,I believed him.,3
SCULLY,So what did you see down in the cellar?,9
MULDER,Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher hole in the wall. Buried alive.,13
SCULLY,How do you know he was alive?,7
MULDER,"Because I was in there with him. And his face was... was different. Even his hair, it was almost feminine. It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.",32
SCULLY,Changing sexes?,2
MULDER,That would explain the hotel security video.,7
SCULLY,So you're saying these people...,5
MULDER,"I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger.",19
SCULLY,Think he was trying to kill me?,7
MULDER,Maybe it's the sex that kills.,6
SCULLY,"Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?",14
MULDER,I don't know.,3
COP,All right. Let's break it up. Out of the car.,10
MARTY (FEMALE),"Sorry, officer.",2
COP,"You, too. You a pro?",5
MARTY (FEMALE),Pro?,1
COP,What?,1
MICHAEL,"On a scale of 1 to 10, she was a kind 3. But there was something about her.",18
SCULLY,Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner?,12
MICHAEL,"Her touch was... electric. But after that, I remember only vaguely.",11
MULDER,What do you remember?,4
MICHAEL,"Nothing, actually.",2
MULDER,"Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene supports what you said, but maybe there was something... unusual about this woman. Something you wouldn't feel comfortable telling the police on the record.",33
MICHAEL,But this is off the record?,6
MULDER,Absolutely.,1
SCULLY,"What did you see, Michael?",5
MICHAEL,"After she left the car and she was fighting with the cop, I saw her in her clothes and she looked like...... she looked like a man.",27
SCULLY,She was a man.,4
MICHAEL,Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple. That's off the record.,14
MULDER,Scout's honor.,2
SCULLY,"Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking for is a transvestite.",15
MULDER,I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species.,18
SCULLY,"I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop? She was a he.",26
AGENT #1,"Agent Mulder? Agent Scully? The credit card that was stolen from the last victim in DC was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown, about 8 blocks from here.",31
MARTY (FEMALE),"It was always forbidden, but after the first time I couldn't help myself. Touching a human man, or a woman, is as powerful for me as it was for you.",30
SCULLY,This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street. It's the Hotel Catherine.,18
MARTY (FEMALE),"Your world offers pleasures - pleasures we don't know because we're different. But you know that now. The others will punish me for what I've done. They'll find me, because the day is coming and they won't leave without me.",39
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
MULDER,Delivery!,1
MULDER,FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!,5
SCULLY,Dead body!,2
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,I'm OK.,2
MULDER,Scully. Down the stairs...,4
SCULLY,"Federal agent, I'm armed! Back away!",6
SCULLY,Step away! Step away!,4
BROTHER ANDREW,Please. Don't hurt him.,4
SCULLY,No. Step away. I'm armed.,5
MULDER,Scully!,1
AGENT #2,MULDER: What if they did get through? There's only place they'd hide.,12
SCULLY,They're gone.,2
AGENT #2,We found something in the hayfield.,6
SCULLY,I don't understand. How can they just disappear? They have no means of transportation.,14
MULDER,No earthly means of transportation.,5
