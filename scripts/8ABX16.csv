BO TAYLOR,You boys eat your vegetables or I'll do the same to you!,12
COOK,"Hot meat, Senor.",3
ENGINEER,¡Hey Amigo! ¿Que pasó esta noche? How was the roast beef? ¿Que cómo está el carne? ¿Bueno o malo?,19
BO TAYLOR,Who's our communications officer?,4
BO TAYLOR,"Hey, what gives with the...",5
BO TAYLOR,What the hell are you doing?,6
BO TAYLOR,Enough.,1
BO TAYLOR,Oh man.,2
BO TAYLOR,Now you gone and done it.,6
DE LA CRUZ,"¡Déjeme! ¡Déjeme! No, no, no, no, nooo, nooo-oooooooo....",8
DOGGETT,"Am I interrupting anything, Agent Mulder?",6
MULDER,Nothing you'd be too terribly interested in Agent Doggett.,9
DOGGETT,Agent Mulder. What are you doing down here?,8
MULDER,Looking into the recent death of an oil worker.,9
DOGGETT,I got a heads up from you a couple of days ago.,12
MULDER,That's what I'm doing here.,5
DOGGETT,"Agent Mulder, I understand you have more than just a proprietary interest in these cases, but I can't help it if you're not assigned to this unit any more. I didn't see any reason to pursue this oil worker case.",40
MULDER,"Well maybe you missed the fact that this victim's corpse washes ashore in Port Arransis, Texas with massive flash burns on 90% of his body.",25
DOGGETT,"I read the report Agent Mulder, if you're insinuating I didn't.",11
MULDER,"Then you must also know that this man was not the only man to disappear from the Galpex-Orpheus platform that night, but one of two men. The communications officer is also missing.",32
DOGGETT,"The company attributes that to an explosion on the rig, a blowout. Which is what they say caused Simon de la Cruz his burns.",24
MULDER,Burns the M.E. said in his report we not inconsistent to exposure to high levels of radiation.,17
DOGGETT,Not inconsistent. It's not exactly who I call a ringing endorsement.,11
MULDER,These files include the same kind of radiation phenomenon. Tissue destroyed by exposure to...,14
DOGGETT,"Black oil. Five years ago, you and Agent Scully investigated a case of a World War Two plane salvaged from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where a sepsis was brought to the surface which you describe as a highly contagious virus of extra-terrestrial origin. That has radioactive properties and can take over a man's body. And it's part of an alien conspiracy to colonise the planet, if I'm not mistaken.",71
MULDER,"And you'd love to help, but you left your light-sabre at home.",12
MULDER,"How'd you get stuck down here, Agent Doggett? Kersh catch you peeing in his cornflakes?",15
DOGGETT,John Doggett.,2
SCULLY,"The Deputy Director is waiting, Agent Doggett.",7
DOGGETT,"Yeah, I was just on my way up.",8
SCULLY,Why didn't you tell me you were pursuing the Texas oil worker case?,13
DOGGETT,'Cause I'm not.,3
SCULLY,Well there's an executive here from the oil company who says he was contacted by a man in our office.,20
DOGGETT,That'd be Agent Mulder.,4
SCULLY,What are you talking about?,5
DOGGETT,I'm gonna to let him answer that.,7
MULDER,Just like old times.,4
KERSH,Now it's all making sense.,5
MULDER,Tough crowd.,2
KERSH,"Mr. Ortega, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder, the person you spoke to on the phone, I believe. Mr. Ortega is Vice President of Operations for Galpex Petroleum out of Galveston, Texas.",32
MULDER,"I believe we did speak, yeah.",6
KERSH,There's also confusion about who spoke to certain Government officials who seem to think the FBI is running an investigation into the accident.,23
MULDER,"That would have been me as well, Sir, and that was in the best interest of the FBI and Mr. Ortega. I believe.",23
KERSH,"Mr. Ortega would beg to differ, as would I.",9
ORTEGA,"You complicated an already sensitive situation, Agent Mulder. Galpex Petroleum has discovered what we think may be a massive new oil province beneath the Gulf of Mexico. One that would give a huge advantage, financially and politically, to whoever gets to drill it.",43
SCULLY,Who else are we talking about?,6
ORTEGA,"US territorial water cover the northern half of the Gulf. Our wells are on our side, but the field may spread well to the south. The Government of Mexico could claim it's theirs.",33
MULDER,This incident has nothing to do with that whatsoever. It's about the unexplained death of Simon de la Cruz.,19
ORTEGA,Simon de la Cruz was a Mexican national killed in a US business enterprise. They'd like nothing better than to use his death to get us to abandon the Orpheus rig so they can be the first to drill the province,41
KERSH,"Leaving me no choice now but to conduct a criminal investigation, quickly and quietly, to take away any legal position that would affect American interests.",25
MULDER,A criminal investigation isn't doing to clear up anything.,9
KERSH,"You've done more than enough Agent Mulder, thank you.",9
MULDER,I don't think you know exactly what you're dealing with here Sir.,12
KERSH,"No, I think I do Agent.",6
MULDER,This is an X-File.,4
KERSH,And I'm sending someone from the X Files to investigate.,10
MULDER,You're talking about an oil rig that's 150 miles out at sea. You cant send a pregnant woman.,18
KERSH,I'm not sending Agent Scully.,5
YURI,"Yuri Volkov, Communications Specialist.",4
SACHS,Bring the new gear?,4
YURI,"Yes, it's in there.",4
DOGGETT,"John Doggett, Special Agent.",4
SACHS,Who?,1
DOGGETT,From the Bureau.,3
SACHS,FBI you say?,3
DOGGETT,Yeah. Someone told you I was coming I hope.,9
SACHS,"No, got some new comm equipment.",6
DOGGETT,You had radio problems? No-one told you about me coming?,10
SACHS,They got got shipped ashore. When they gave us the message it said just one Agent was coming.,18
DOGGETT,"Right, I'm the one Agent.",5
SACHS,"Well then, who's the guy who get here this morning? Been talking to the crew chief for an hour.",19
DOGGETT,"Agent Mulder, can I have a word with you?",9
MULDER,"If you give me a minute, I'm just getting in with details of the investigation. Why don't you pull up a chair and introduce yourself so Mr. Taylor won't have to repeat himself.",33
TAYLOR,I'm Bo Taylor. I was on night watch the day this thing went down.,14
DOGGETT,Go on Mr. Taylor.,4
TAYLOR,"Men can go off the deep end out here, it's like a cabin fever of sorts. They're hundreds of miles away from their family and friends, 6 weeks at a stretch. Some of them might just well be doing hard time.",41
DOGGETT,"So how does that figure with the victim, Simon de la Cruz?",12
TAYLOR,"Well, mestizos are normally the most reliable men I know off on the drill floor. Simon, just lost his nut I guess. It's the only good explanation.",27
DOGGETT,Simon de la Cruz's body was found with flash burns. What's that got to do with him going off the deep end?,22
TAYLOR,"Well hell, he tried to blow the whole damn rig. I mean it was sabotage, pure and simple. He knocked a cock of the gas valve, he must have sparked it cause it went faster than a Friday paycheck.",39
DOGGETT,What about the second victim?,5
MULDER,"Communications chief, wasn't he?",4
TAYLOR,He probably never knew what hit him.,7
DOGGETT,What's the communications chief doing on the drilling floor?,9
TAYLOR,"A man can die out here sir, just going for a walk. Probably what happened when it blew. Nobody knew he was gone until the shift change.",27
MULDER,"I guess that's it, in a nutshell. Thank you Mr. Taylor.",11
DOGGETT,Agent Mulder...,2
DOGGETT,"Agent Mulder, don't walk away when I'm talking to you. Like it or not I've been assigned this case. One call to the Deputy Director and your up for insubordination.",30
MULDER,How are you going to call when the radio's broken?,10
DOGGETT,Don't push me Agent Mulder.,5
MULDER,You won't do it.,4
DOGGETT,You think?,2
MULDER,"We're both in the same boat, Agent Doggett. We're just paddling in different directions.",14
DOGGETT,"No we're not going in different directions here, we're going in one direction. My direction.",15
MULDER,"I don't think Kersh expects you to come back empty handed on this one. Since you have already told me about what you think about this case in so many words, I don't see you coming back with anything that's gonna protect anybody's business interests let alone your own ass.",50
DOGGETT,"Well you really got me pegged. Anything that doesn't fit in my narrow field of vision might as well not exist, is that right Agent Mulder? So why is this man Taylor lying? You do know he's lying?",38
MULDER,"I think he knows that truth about what happened, and he may not be the only one.",17
DOGGETT,I never would have believed it. These stories about you.,10
MULDER,"Really, what stories are those?",5
DOGGETT,That you can find a conspiracy at a church picnic.,10
MULDER,What church?,2
SCULLY,Close the door and lock it.,6
SKINNER,What's going on? You said you wanted to see me straight away.,12
SCULLY,"I didn't know who else to talk to, and I haven't been able to reach Agent Mulder.",17
SKINNER,About what?,2
SCULLY,"About what I found in my autopsy of the oil rig victim, Simon de la Cruz",16
SKINNER,"Agent Scully, this man's body was supposed to be transported back to Mexico completely intact.",15
SCULLY,I found it by accident in the third ventricle of his brain.,12
SKINNER,Scully!,1
SCULLY,"No it's OK, it's alright.",5
SKINNER,What do you mean? I was under the impression that this stuff could literally jump into a man's body.,19
SCULLY,"No, it can, and I've seen that happen. But that's the thing - this man was clearly infected by the alien virus. It entered his system and it was massing in the pineal gland, but it's dead.",36
SKINNER,What killed it?,3
SCULLY,"Well intuitively, you would say the same thing that killed him - exposure to high levels of radiation. But it makes no sense because the virus itself has radioactive properties.",29
SKINNER,Someone needs to tell Agent Doggett that. He needs to have some kind of idea as to what he's dealing with out there.,23
SCULLY,"No, you need to tell Deputy Director Kersh that he has to order a controlled evacuation of that rig right now.",21
SKINNER,Don't tell me to go to Kersh with this evidence. Telling him to order an evacuation for something that you cant even explain,23
SCULLY,"If the virus is loose, Agent Doggett's life is in danger.",11
SKINNER,We don't know that for sure. There are nearly two dozen men on that rig and not one other case. Why?,21
TAYLOR,"Hey Yuri, heard you had some problems with the radio.",10
YURI,This gear's all online working fine. But there's some sort of high frequency interference that I have no idea how to get rid off. Hear that? That's the signal that's coming in. Filtering in across a large range of channels. I don't think I have any choice but to power down and restore.,53
TAYLOR,"No, you can't do that!",5
YURI,I hate to argue with you.,6
MARINE OPERATOR,"This is the marine operator for Galpex-Orpheus. Come in Orpheus. I have a priority transmission, repeat, this is a priority transmission.",21
YURI,"This is Orpheus, go ahead.",5
SCULLY,"Orpheus, I've been trying to reach you for hours. This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I have an urgent message for an investigative agent on board, an Agent John Doggett.",30
YURI,I'm ready to take that message.,6
SCULLY,"No I'm sorry, I need to speak with Agent Doggett directly.",11
MULDER,"I got it Well I'm sorry, Agent Doggett's gone fishing. Can I take a message please?",16
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,I was just in the neighbourhood.,6
SCULLY,Mulder you can't just flout orders like this. It's not like old times. Kersh isn't going to tolerate this.,19
MULDER,Kersh doesn't need to know.,5
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"You need me out here Scully, you know that better than anyone.",12
SCULLY,I'd hate to say as of this morning I'd have to agree.,12
MULDER,"Who's flouting orders, you found something didn't you, in that victim's body. The virus?",14
SCULLY,"Yes I did, and it's dead Mulder.",7
MULDER,Dead? What killed it?,4
SCULLY,Possibly radiation.,2
MULDER,That's not possible.,3
SCULLY,"I know I know, and this could be an isolated event, but that he's infected at all means that everybody out there could be at risk. And that means you and Agent Doggett.",33
MULDER,We got to quarantine this rig.,6
SCULLY,"No Mulder, you need to get off the rig. Have Agent Doggett give the order. We can quarantine you and the crew when we get back here.",27
MULDER,"Scully, if these men are infected the last place we want to is onshore where they can infect other people. You're sitting on the answer right there, Scully. The body, you find the virus, you can find what knocks it out, you can find what kills it.",47
SCULLY,And what if I can't?,5
MULDER,"When he's old enough, tell the kid I went down swinging!",11
SCULLY,Let me talk to Agent Doggett.,6
MULDER,Agent Doggett's not here right now.,6
DOGETT,Who was that on the radio?,6
DOGGETT,Who were you talking to?,5
DOGGETT,Hey!,1
MULDER,That was Agent Scully.,4
DOGGETT,What did she say?,4
MULDER,She said it was lucky that I'm out here.,9
DOGGETT,"No, you're lucky that I'm letting you stay. You got information important to this investigation then I damn well better know about it. I'm in charge out here, Agent.",29
MULDER,"Alright, then go ahead and take charge, Only you might not like what it means in this case. What you're going to have to do with that information you're so anxious to have.",33
SACHS,"Alright, listen up. I'm gonna make this brief. We've been given an order to quarantine the rig. At fourteen hundred hours we officially shut down and lock down. You're gonna be stuck here a while, all flights in and out have been suspended. I know I know, you're gonna have to cooperate until the FBI's certain everything is shipshape. Now for everybody's protection we need to all of us cooperate fully.",71
ED DELL,Oh man!,2
TAYLOR,Protection from what?,3
DOGGETT,From a possible contagion.,4
TAYLOR,Anybody here feel sick?,4
CREW,No!,1
SACHS,"Alright, knock it off, I need everybody to check their water consumption, and we'll be cutting back to half rations.",20
MULDER,"I've been going over the crew manifest Mr. Sachs, and there appears to be a problem.",16
SACHS,Problem with what?,3
MULDER,According to the manifest there's supposed to be eighteen men onboard. I count only seventeen including you.,17
SACHS,"This is my whole crew in here. DE LA CRUZ, SIMON DELL, ED GARZA, DIEGO GORDON, MAC HARBOUR, ROBERT HOXWORTH, JACK",21
MULDER,"Diego Garza, where's he?",4
DOGGETT,Who?,1
SACHS,Deck hand. A friend of Simon de la Cruz. The man who tried to sabotage the rig. Well I'll be damned.,21
DOGGETT,"What, he's not here?",4
MULDER,Any idea where he might be?,6
SACHS,"Well he didn't leave the rig, not by any means I know of.",13
MULDER,What do you say we go and find him?,9
SCULLY,This man was exposed to a virus.,7
ORTEGA,And why do I need to see this?,8
SCULLY,To understand what your crew may be infected with. What they risk spreading on or off that rig.,18
ORTEGA,"You understand Galpex is eager to cooperate, but shutting down a producing rig costs us in the neighbourhood of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, a day, and according to my OIM, no-one on that rig is sick, they're just hungry and tired.",43
SKINNER,You don't know that for sure.,6
ORTEGA,"Well, what symptoms would they be showing, what would we see?",11
SCULLY,"Unexplained behaviour, possible detection in the eyes ..",7
ORTEGA,We've seen none of that.,5
SKINNER,You're relying on suspect data.,5
ORTEGA,"I'm relying on medical reports, and unless you give me more than this, I'm calling that Orpheus crew back in. bringing them home, and rotating a fresh crew onto that rig.",31
SCULLY,Oh my god.,3
DOGGETT,"So what are hoping to find Agent Mulder, honestly?",9
MULDER,I'm hoping to find Diego Garza.,6
DOGGETT,There's no chance of that if you ask me. A man could disappear of this platform and no-one would even notice.,21
MULDER,"Did you see the crew manifest? It listed Diego Garza as mestizo, of mixed Mexican descent, just like his friend who died?",22
DOGGETT,Yeah. So what?,3
MULDER,"Well the crew chief said these mestizo were particularly good workers, but we've got one dead trying to sabotage the rig and another missing. If he's one of their best workers you'd think someone would've noticed him missing.",38
DOGGETT,Yeah so maybe he's still here. Maybe he's just waiting to finish the job that killed his friend to protect Mexican oil.,22
MULDER,"These men are hiding something, but that's not it.",9
DOGGETT,"You know, I quarantine a whole damn oil rig without any evidence to support what you're saying, not one damn thing, but you still have yet to give me straight answer as to what you think is going on out here. If these men are hiding something, if they're protecting something, then what the hell is it?",57
MULDER,I don't know yet.,4
DOGGETT,"And when you do, let me know, cause I've got to get on the radio to justify this action.",19
MULDER,"I didn't come out here just to bust your ass. I'm telling you, I've seen this substance. I've seen it can take over a man's body. This crew could be infected and not even know it. They may have no idea they're being controlled.",44
DOGGETT,This? This is what you're saying is going to take over my body? Well when's it going to kick in?,20
MULDER,"That's not how it works. It body jumps from man to man, and I'm not sure that it's in all oil.",21
DOGGETT,"Well that's a relief, because only ninety percent of the planet is dependent on the stuff.",16
MULDER,The man from Galpex oil lied...,6
DOGGETT,"What, he's infected too?",4
MULDER,"No, that new oil field is already in production. It's already being pumped by this rig. That's how this crew got infected.",22
DOGGETT,You're reaching Agent Mulder,4
MULDER,"Billions and billions of barrels lying right underneath us, waiting to be produced, waiting to infect that ninety percent of the planet you talked about.",25
DOGGETT,If these men are hiding something. That'd sure be something to hide.,12
MULDER,"Agent Doggett what if that's why this man is hiding, this Diego Garza, because he knows what they're up to, and he knows what they're up to because he's the only one who's not infected with this alien virus.",39
DOGGETT,"Alright, he knows. Why doesn't he just come down here and tell us?",13
MULDER,It's the radio room!,4
DOGGETT,I'll go find another one.,5
KERSH,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,Sir?,1
KERSH,You're in a hurry. To do what?,7
SCULLY,"To continue with my work, Sir.",6
KERSH,I'm not privy to this work. I'd have thought this body would have been on its way back to Mexico.,20
KERSH,"I obviously haven't been able to rely on those whose job it is to keep me apprised and informed. I have to rely on phone calls, like the call I received from Martin Ortega. Why doesn't somebody make me privy to who the hell gave the order to shut down that rig.",52
SKINNER,I did.,2
KERSH,Well I'm giving the order that this quarantine is lifted.,10
SCULLY,"We could do that Sir, but all radio contact has been cut off.",13
KERSH,"As soon as it's re-established I want that rig up and running, and the entire crew choppered off the Galpex-Orpheus and debriefed.",22
SCULLY,"Sir, I think that would be a mistake...",8
KERSH,"I think it would be a mistake not to, Agent Scully. And you're running out of mistakes, both you, and the Assistant Director. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a Mulder stunt.",35
SACHS,This stuff was all brand new.,6
MULDER,What is it about this room that inspires men to violence?,11
SACHS,You think this fire was set?,6
MULDER,Molotov cocktail anyone?,3
MULDER,"Can I borrow your radio Mr. Sachs? Agent Doggett, you there?",11
MULDER'S VOICE ON RADIO,"Agent Doggett, do you copy?",5
MULDER,Agent Doggett. Come in Agent Doggett.,6
GARZA,Sangre colorada,2
DOGGETT,Yeah my blood's red.,4
GARZA,"Lo mataron a Simón. Soy el único que queda. Si me encuentran, me matan.",14
DOGGETT,Tranquilo. I don't speak very good Spanish. Diego. Tu eres Diego Garza??,12
GARZA,"Lo mataron, yo los miré. Ellos querían el radio. Por eso es que encendí la lumbre.",16
DOGGETT,That's too fast. You're saying you set the fire? What are you afraid of?,14
GARZA,Tenemos que detenerlos antes que sea muy tarde. Ya vienen! Ya vienen!,12
DOGGETT,Vienen. Vienen They're coming? Who? Who's coming?,7
GARZA,Los platillos. Los platillos voladores.,5
SCULLY,I think I've got something.,5
SKINNER,What?,1
SCULLY,This is an SEM image pulled at random from anonymous donors.,11
SKINNER,What off?,2
SCULLY,"Blood. More specifically, normal T-cell antibodies. By comparison these are from the blood of the oil rig worker T-cells in impossible numbers. In layman's terms, this victim was a virus fighting machine.",32
SKINNER,How do you explain that?,5
SCULLY,"Well, there are isolated cultures. In northern Italy for one, where people are immune to certain diseases - heart disease in that case, through a genetic mutation.",26
SKINNER,"So this man had what, kind of genetic immunity to the alien virus?",13
SCULLY,"Well his employment records list Mr. Simon de la Cruz as of mixed Mexican ancestry, when in fact he is Waicha Indian. The Waicha are an indigenous Mexican culture that has a rare undiluted gene pool. Now these genes may have an innate immunity to infection.",46
SKINNER,"OK, so he was immune to the virus. That's still not what killed him. He died from being burned.",19
SCULLY,"No, not burned. Irradiated. Because the virus had no effect on him. The crew members who were affected by the virus couldn't control him, so they killed him, by irradiating him.",31
SKINNER,Then why not kill Mulder? Or Agent Doggett? Why kill only this man?,13
SCULLY,"This man must have been a threat, because of something he knew.",12
SKINNER,What?,1
SCULLY,That I don't know.,4
SKINNER,"So even if we did know, and were able to give word to them, It'd put Mulder and Agent Doggett in danger too. Wouldn't it?",25
DOGGETT,¿Su familia? ¿Fotografía? Your family? You want to get back to them? I can help you. Señor. Confía en mí.,20
GARZA,Yo no confío en nadie.,5
DOGGETT,"Right. Trust no one. If you stay here, they will find you, just like your friend. Let me go. I will get you back home. You have my word. Mi promesa.",31
TAYLOR,Where's Garza?,2
TAYLOR,Where is he?,3
DOGGETT,I'll go get Agent Mulder.,5
MULDER,"Get up, Agent Doggett. There's more where that came from.",10
MULDER,"You know anything about radio, Agent Doggett?",7
DOGGETT,"Yeah, I know a little.",5
MULDER,Let's see what little you know and get that ship-to-shore working.,11
DOGGETT,Call who?,2
MULDER,Anybody who can get us off here.,7
MULDER,Get to work!,3
MULDER,Agent Doggett!,2
DOGGETT,I'm working on it.,4
MULDER,I don't think this door is going to hold much longer.,11
MULDER,Wagner?,1
DOGGETT,What do you want?,4
MULDER,I take it back. It's perfect.,6
VOICE ON RADIO,"Orpheus, this is the Marine Operator. I repeat, this is an emergency priority transmission for the Galpex-Orpheus.",17
DOGGETT,"Yeah, you got John Doggett on board the Galpex-Orpheus. Come in.",11
DOGGETT,This is John Doggett.,4
SCULLY,Agent Doggett?,2
DOGGETT,"Agent Scully, yeah, I'm right here.",6
SCULLY,Can you hear me?,4
DOGGETT,Yes!,1
SCULLY,What was that?,3
MULDER,That's someone knocking on the door.,6
SCULLY,"Mulder, listen to me.",4
SCULLY,"I think I know why they killed this man, if not how they killed him.",15
DOGGETT,Right now we got bigger problems. We need a chopper.,10
SCULLY,We've got choppers on the way.,6
MULDER,Tell her all the men here are infected. She's got to get the word to the choppers. Not to land on the platform.,23
DOGGETT,"Well, how they supposed to get us?",7
MULDER,"Well, that problem is rapidly becoming moot!",7
DOGGETT,"Agent Scully, listen - there are three men on board here that are not infected, me, Mulder and a man named Diego Garza who may be mentally unstable, could be why he tried to wreck this radio room just like his friend Simon de la Cruz. He may resist rescue attempt because he believes there are men in flying saucers who are coming to get him. Agent Scully, do you get that? Agent Scully?",73
DOGGETT,You're breaking up!,3
DOGGETT,What the hell are you doing?,6
MULDER,Destroying their ability to transmit just like Diego and Simon de la Cruz.,13
DOGGETT,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,I'm talking about contact.,4
DOGGETT,Contact with whom? The mother ship?,6
MULDER,"Agent Doggett, listen.",3
DOGGETT,Now you just back off.,5
MULDER,"No, no, no, listen.",4
DOGGETT,Where they go?,3
MULDER,"I don't know, and I don't want to stick around to find out.",13
MULDER,"Let's go, Agent Doggett.",4
DOGGETT,Agent Mulder! I can't leave him.,6
MULDER,Who?,1
DOGGETT,Diego Garza.,2
MULDER,Agent Doggett!,2
DOGGETT,¡Diego! ¡Diego! ¿Donde estás?,4
DOGGETT,"Diego, get up. Come on, let's go.",7
MULDER,Is he coming?,3
DOGGETT,No.,1
VOICE ON RADIO,Come in Galpex-Orpheus.,3
MULDER,"Agent Doggett, I think I know why they let us go.",11
DOGGETT,"What?! Agent Mulder, what are you talking about? What's going on?",11
MULDER,They're going to blow the rig.,6
DOGGETT,Who?,1
DOGGETT,Let's go.,2
DOGGETT,What's he saying?,3
MULDER,I think he wants us to jump.,7
DOGGETT,"Now, wait a minute Agent Mulder, I'm in charge here. On two count.",13
MULDER,How about a 20 count?,5
DOGGETT,One! Two!,2
MULDER,"Where's the fire, Agent Doggett?",5
DOGGETT,I've been called up to see Deputy Director Kersh. As have Agent Scully and AD Skinner. I think it's all hitting the fan.,23
MULDER,You mean Galpex Oil?,4
DOGGETT,Word came down that Galpex has lost the right to drill that entire Texas oil province.,16
MULDER,That oil should stay right where it is. You should do everything in your power to make sure that it does.,21
DOGGETT,Me?,1
MULDER,"That is the Deputy Director calling to tell you there is no need to see you. That the blame has been properly assigned for what happened out on that platform. I'm out. 86'd, Agent Doggett.",35
DOGGETT,What do you mean. You're out of the FBI?,9
MULDER,Kersh could barely contain his happiness. He stuck it to me.,11
DOGGETT,"So, you taking the fall?",5
DOGGETT,Not for me?,3
MULDER,For you. For the X-Files. You're all the credibility this office has left. You have Kersh's ear and you have seen it now. Out on that platform. You saw it for yourself.,32
MULDER,"Answer the phone, Agent Doggett. You're in charge here now.",10
