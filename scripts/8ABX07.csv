AGENT STEDMAN,"Damn, Jim, you fell asleep? We're on a stakeout, man.",10
AGENT LEEDS,I guess... I don't know.,5
AGENT STEDMAN,What happened over there?,4
AGENT LEEDS,What are you talking about?,5
AGENT STEDMAN,"The house, man. Front door's wide open. How long you been out?",12
AGENT STEDMAN,We'd better check it.,4
AGENT STEDMAN,The light's out. The door's open. I don't like this.,10
AGENT LEEDS,Looks like they all left.,5
AGENT STEDMAN,I'm not so sure.,4
AGENT LEEDS,This can't be.,3
AGENT LEEDS,"Oh, God. Stedman!",3
AGENT STEDMAN,They're all dead.,3
DOGGETT,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"It's, uh, it's Agent Scully. I'm sorry to wake you.",10
DOGGETT,What's up?,2
SCULLY,I got a call about 20 minutes ago from Assistant Director Skinner. He has a situation.,16
DOGGETT,What is it?,3
SCULLY,"An Agent is dead. Um, Skinner had him surveilling a religious cult in Pittsburgh. And all the followers are dead, as well.",22
DOGGETT,What happened?,2
SCULLY,He's having difficulty determining that.,5
DOGGETT,I'll pick you up.,4
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, Agent Doggett. I can't go.",7
DOGGETT,Agent Scully?,2
SCULLY,"Um, something unexpected has come up.",6
DOGGETT,You all right?,3
SCULLY,"Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.",4
DOGGETT,Will I see you later?,5
SCULLY,"Uh, as soon as I can.",6
NURSE,Miss Scully? The doctor wants to see you right away.,10
SKINNER,Where's Agent Scully?,3
DOGGETT,Running late. What do we have?,6
SKINNER,One of our men doing routine surveillance on a cult group-- the Ibogan Temple. We had a tip they were trafficking narcotics. Nobody suspected anything like this.,27
SKINNER,"Agent James Leeds. Six-year veteran of the Bureau, father of two. Patrol cop found him. Car was locked from the inside.",21
DOGGETT,Nobody saw or heard anything?,5
SKINNER,No.,1
DOGGETT,This couldn't have happened here.,5
SKINNER,Blood splatter on the seat says it did.,8
DOGGETT,"It's too narrow. There's no room to swing the weapon. Besides, it doesn't make any sense. The gun's still holstered and the key's in the ignition. Even if he fell asleep...",31
DOGGETT,This is damn weird.,4
SKINNER,It gets weirder.,3
SKINNER,These people were all killed the same way as our guy. All 20 cult members dead from a single deep wound to the forehead.,24
DOGGETT,Is this every member?,4
SKINNER,"Except one. Their leader, Anthony Tipet, is missing.",8
SKINNER,"Tipet was a convicted murderer who claimed to have found God. We didn't think we were dealing with an apocalyptic cult. We've seen this kind of thing before. Jonestown, Heaven's Gate.",31
DOGGETT,I don't care how devoted they were. These people wouldn't just lie here and let their leader bash their brains in. I got to figure at least one of them would have had a problem with that.,37
SKINNER,It's something I've considered. I'm running tox tests on all the bodies for drugs.,14
DOGGETT,Does that include our man in the car?,8
AGENT CRANE,A.D. Skinner? We're still unable to locate Agent Stedman.,9
DOGGETT,Angus Stedman?,2
SKINNER,"Leeds' partner, do you know him?",6
DOGGETT,Where'd you look?,3
AGENT CRANE,He wasn't checked into the same motel as Leeds. He's not answering his cell or his pager.,17
DOGGETT,Did you check his condo?,5
AGENT CRANE,His condo?,2
DOGGETT,"Yeah, Stedman's from Pittsburgh. He keeps a condo here that belonged to his folks.",14
DOGGETT,"Angus Stedman, it's John Doggett.",5
SKINNER,Doggett.,1
ANTHONY TIPET,The body is but clay... a shell If we have the courage to see into darkness we see into God... free of the clay which confines us.,27
SKINNER,"Anthony Tipet served 12 years for the bludgeoning death of his wife. After his release, he became a minister preaching a hybrid of evangelical and eastern religions. He claimed a higher plane of being could be reached by the Via Negativa-- the path of darkness-- the plane closer to God. Once reached, it would let the spirit travel unhindered. Tipet believed hallucinogens would lead him to this plane-- specifically compounds of the bark of an African tree... the Iboga.",79
SENIOR AGENT,You're saying all these people were so stoned on this bark they just let their leader kill them?,18
SKINNER,We found no trace of the drug in the blood of any of the victims.,15
KERSH,I don't understand. How in the hell did Tipet manage to slaughter all these people?,15
DOGGETT,Tipet was paranoid but nothing indicates he was ready to take the lives of his own people or our men.,20
KERSH,This is our one and only suspect. Are you telling me he didn't do it?,15
DOGGETT,"Whoever did this left not even a trace how: No prints, no forensic evidence whatsoever. Agent Leeds' sedan, the cult house, Agent Stedman's condoâ€¦ were all locked from the inside.",30
KERSH,That's impossible.,2
SKINNER,Unless Tipet took the drug and succeeded. Unless his consciousness was there but his body was somewhere else.,18
KERSH,The X-File explanation. I take it this theory comes from Agent Scully?,12
DOGGETT,"Agent Scully has yet to reach any conclusions, sir.",9
KERSH,That's the problem. I'm not hearing conclusions from either one of you. If this man has reached a higher plane then explain to me why 22 people are dead including two FBI Agents. Now I want to hear what you're going to do about it.,45
DOGGETT,"If I'm working this case, I'd appreciate a heads up before you tell the Deputy Director any more science fiction stories.",21
SKINNER,"Hey, I don't have another explanation.",6
DOGGETT,Those guys in there are right. This whole story doesn't make a damn bit of sense.,16
SKINNER,"I'm supposed to give those guys in there answers, Agent Doggett. You're supposed to help me do that.",18
DOGGETT,"Tipet's on the run. Find him, and we just might.",10
HOMELESS MAN,Spare change?,2
ANTHONY TIPET,I don't have anything. Sorry.,5
HOMELESS MAN,"Now, come on, man. I know you got something 'cause I hear it jingling in your pocket.",17
ANTHONY TIPET,You don't want to know me.,6
ANTHONY TIPET,"Pick up the phone, damn you. Pick up the damn phone! You did this. You... did this. God help you, Andre. I can't.",23
ANDRE BORMANIS,Ah!,1
SKINNER,Agent Doggett. Coroner's report.,4
DOGGETT,"Victims all killed by a single blow from an axe blade, six to eight inches long.",16
SKINNER,These photos of wound patterns don't match up to any known make or manufacturer.,14
DOGGETT,This fit the description?,4
DOGGETT,It's a ceremonial axe used over a thousand years ago to cleave the skulls of unbelievers. This was required reading for Tipet's followers.,23
SKINNER,Is this our weapon?,4
DOGGETT,"No, sir. It's on permanent display in a Calcutta museum.",10
SKINNER,Another dead-end.,2
DOGGETT,Like everything else in this case.,6
DOGGETT,I'm a good investigator but you know as well as I do I'm not the Agent that should be investigating this case.,22
SKINNER,Agent Scully can't be here.,5
DOGGETT,You spoke to her?,4
SKINNER,Tonight. She told me to tell you she's fine. She's taking some personal time.,14
DOGGETT,"I've got 22 people dead, and she's taking personal time?",10
SKINNER,You're not listening to what I'm telling you. Do your best without her.,13
HOMELESS MAN,Spare change? I'll take whatever you got.,7
HOMELESS MAN,"Ah, no! No!!",3
DOGGETT,Sir?,1
SKINNER,I think we caught a break. A homeless man was found dead in Pittsburgh two hours ago. I had them e-mail me some digital photos.,25
DOGGETT,Any witnesses?,2
SKINNER,A man fitting Tipet's description was ID'd using the pay phone earlier in the night.,15
DOGGETT,So we got something?,4
SKINNER,"No. There's no concrete evidence against him. There's no fingerprints, no hair and fiber.",14
[TD,"""Concrete evidence""? A groaner from Skinner, gotta be a first!]",10
DOGGETT,You got the guy at the scene.,7
SKINNER,"There's nothing to link him to the murder itself, Agent Doggett.",11
DOGGETT,"Well, I'm supposed to believe this guy doped his way into another plane of reality? That his spirit is going around killing people?",23
SKINNER,"All right, just suppose... suppose that this drug finally did what Tipet said it would. That his spirit could be in one place while his body was in another.",29
DOGGETT,"Then tell me why he's doing it. If he's looking for God, why is he killing people? Just 'cause I'm assigned to the X-Files you want me to think like Scully or Mulder would. You got the wrong guy. I need facts, not wild ideas.",45
SKINNER,All right. Then consider this one. I had Pittsburgh P.D. check the log at that pay phone. 11. 412 555 4344 MK Stone,23

DOGGETT,"10:12 PM, a call was placed to one Andre Bormanis.",10
SKINNER,He's a convicted drug dealer that served time with Tipet. That number's a DC area code.,16
DOGGETT,FBI. Open up.,3
DOGGETT,Mr. Bormanis? Andre Bormanis?,4
ANDRE BORMANIS,Doctor Bormanis.,2
DOGGETT,Agent Doggett. Agent Skinner. Can we have a word with you?,11
SKINNER,"You always up at this hour, Dr. Bormanis?",8
ANDRE BORMANIS,It's when I dissect my rats. Neighbors can't hear 'em screaming.,11
ANDRE BORMANIS,That's a joke.,3
SKINNER,You spoke to Anthony Tipet earlier this evening.,8
ANDRE BORMANIS,My machine picked up. I-I-I missed the call.,8
SKINNER,What did he want?,4
SKINNER,"We need to find him, Dr. Bormanis. This man may have murdered 23 people.",14
ANDRE BORMANIS,Twenty-three? You-you said... twenty-two.,4
SKINNER,Another man died tonight.,4
ANDRE BORMANIS,I'm not doing anything illegal here. I... I just... I just made him stuff.,14
SKINNER,"You mean drugs. You supplied Anthony Tipet with drugs, isn't that right?",12
ANDRE BORMANIS,"Hallucinogens were Tipet's way into the depths of the soul, the heights of consciousness, planes of being that our feeble brain chemistry cannot begin to imagine.",26
SKINNER,"Is that why you cut yourself? Or is that the, uh... mark of the initiated?",15
ANDRE BORMANIS,"It's a protection. At least I hope it is. Nobody took the trips but Tipet. See, only his mind was strong enough.",22
DOGGETT,"You know, I can't tell, doctor, whether you admire Tipet or you're afraid of him. Those people he killed last night, did they admire him, too?",26
ANDRE BORMANIS,What are you doing?,4
DOGGETT,Taking you in for questioning.,5
ANDRE BORMANIS,On what charges? I just... I just... explained it to you.,11
ANDRE BORMANIS,Ah! Don't! Look...,3
ANDRE BORMANIS,I need that!,3
ANDRE BORMANIS,"No, please! Ugh! Don't-don't leave me! Please!! Don't leave me!",10
[TD,"And I dropped my jaw! Way cool and very freaky stuff, I vote this one of the Top Ten Best Scenes on the show to date. Spooky!]",27
SKINNER,Agent Doggett?,2
SKINNER,It's Agent Scully.,3
DOGGETT,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,Skinner told me about the case. I know that you covered for me. You didn't have to do that.,19
DOGGETT,It's all right.,3
SCULLY,I appreciate your discretion.,4
DOGGETT,"Yeah, well, it's easy to be discreet when you don't know what's going on. Are you okay?",17
SCULLY,I'm fine. Skinner says that you're on the clock on this thing. You need to get your rest.,18
DOGGETT,"Yeah, I just grabbed a few winks.",7
SCULLY,I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder's. I think they'll be able to help.,16
DOGGETT,I appreciate all the help I can get.,8
SCULLY,"Doggett, you're a good agent. Trust your instincts.",8
SKINNER,"Lab tests showed that the drug that Bormanis was cooking up was some kind of a super amphetamine. Legal or not, no one's ever seen it before. Do you think it was intended for Tipet?",35
DOGGETT,He wants it for himself. He doesn't want to go to sleep.,12
SKINNER,Doggett?,1
DOGGETT,I want to talk to him... now.,7
DOGGETT,Can we get this gate open? Get it open now!,10
ANDRE BORMANIS,Ugh!,1
[TD,"He, he, indeedy, lots of 'em, yuck!]",7
ANDRE BORMANIS,Ugh!,1
SKINNER,"Agent Doggett, what is it?",5
DOGGETT,Open it up.,3
BYERS,"...stories that belong to Mulder and Scully, not us.",9
LANGLY,"Come on, Byers. We have a right to information.",9
BYERS,It's not our information.,4
FROHIKE,How many times have we saved Mulder's butt?,8
LANGLY,How many times have we saved Scully's?,7
BYERS,"I'm telling you, these files are theirs. They're private.",9
[TD,"Took me a minute to figure out what Langly was doing as well. He's lining up a pencil and shoots it at the ceiling when they notice Doggett in the doorway. A nod to ""Chinga"" *sniff*]",36
FROHIKE,And I'm telling you Mulder wouldn't mind. We practically solved half these cases for him.,15
LANGLY,"Yeah, Byers, quit your whining-- nobody likes a crybaby.",9
BYERS,Agent Scully asked us to give our assistance not to go through her f-files.,14
FROHIKE,Like she's going to care.,5
LANGLY,"Yeah, right.",2
DOGGETT,Can I help you gentlemen?,5
BYERS,"You must be Agent Doggett. I'm... John Byers. Uh, these are my associates Melvin Frohike and Richard Langly.",18
DOGGETT,You're the guys Scully told me about. Mulder's friends?,9
BYERS,"Yes, that's us.",3
DOGGETT,"You publish the ""Lone Gunman"" newspaper?",6
FROHIKE,Our reputation precedes us.,4
DOGGETT,Yeah. Read Mulder's files.,4
FROHIKE,"Well, then you know how badly you're going to need our help.",12
BYERS,We've reviewed your case as Agent Scully asked.,8
LANGLY,"Mondo bizarro. No offense, man, but you're in way over your head.",12
DOGGETT,What help can you give me?,6
FROHIKE,Hit the lights.,3
FROHIKE,Are you familiar with this image?,6
BYERS,In the renaissance it represented an all-seeing god.,8
LANGLY,That's why our Founding Fathers put it on the dollar bill.,11
BYERS,"We believe its meaning here relates to eastern religion, uh, belief in the third eye or what the Hindus call the Sahasrara.",22
DOGGETT,A third eye?,3
FROHIKE,"We all have a third eye. If we could open it, we'd see a new reality, one closer to God. At least that's what Kesey told me on the bus back in '64.",33
LANGLY,You were not on the bus with Kesey in '64.,10
FROHIKE,"Hey, I got the pictures to prove it, my longhaired friend.",11
LANGLY,Before or after you partied with the Stones at Altamont?,10
FROHIKE,"Don't be a boob, Altamont was in '70s.",8
LANGLY,Whatever.,1
DOGGETT,I see where you guys are going with this. Tipet believes he opened his third eye.,16
BYERS,"Yes, exactly.",2
DOGGETT,But the placement of the wounds on his victims could suggest he's trying to destroy theirs.,16
BYERS,Yeah. That could be.,4
DOGGETT,"But if he's moved closer to God, why kill him? And how?",12
FROHIKE,We don't know why. But we might tell you how.,10
FROHIKE,You've heard of MK Ultra?,5
BYERS,The CIA mind control project started in the '50s.,9
LANGLY,They gave LSD to a bunch of people to see what would happen. Didn't bother telling them first.,18
FROHIKE,They understood the power of hallucinogens to harness the mind.,10
DOGGETT,"Tipet was the one on hallucinogens, not his victims.",9
BYERS,"The CIA invested millions trying to create psychic assassins, failing where Tipet has evidently succeeded.",15
FROHIKE,Reaching a drug-induced higher consciousness using his mind as a weapon against his victims.,14
LANGLY,The assassin makes his victims think they're being hit by an axe.,12
BYERS,Or any number of nightmares.,5
FROHIKE,They believe it... it happens.,5
DOGGETT,"What if Tipet could invade his victims'... consciousness in their sleep? I mean, that's why you'd be afraid to fall asleep, right? If you thought your nightmares might come true?",30
BYERS,You believe that?,3
DOGGETT,No... but if Tipet does... he'll need more drugs... to keep killing.,12
FROHIKE,That's not bad for a beginner.,6
SKINNER,"Doggett, someone's been here.",4
DOGGETT,Anthony Tipet. Anthony Tipet! Step away from the saw.,9
ANTHONY TIPET,You don't understand.,3
SKINNER,Just step away from the saw.,6
ANTHONY TIPET,I didn't want this to happen... but I can't stop it.,11
ANTHONY TIPET,He understands. He saw what can happen-- what will happen... unless I stop it.,14
ER DOCTOR,"I want a stat trauma panel with full tox, EKG, and metabolic profile. Keep that compress on his head.",19
NURSE,Agent... this man needs to be admitted. You need to sign him in.,13
NURSE,"This is Nurse McCaslin. Yes, Dr. Johnson's on the third floor. All right.",13
KERSH,"Come in, Agent Doggett. A.D. Skinner was telling me you could shed light on the reason for Tipet's suicide attempt.",20
DOGGETT,"Yes, sir, um... ""Via Negativa""-- the path of darkness. Tipet believed he reached it. Uh, he believed that the drugs took him inside the subconscious minds of anyone he knew...... making the most horrific, irrational dream imagery of their nightmares come true. That's why he tried to kill himself to make it stop.",53
KERSH,"Excellent job, gentlemen. Have your reports on my desk 0900.",10
DOGGETT,"Case isn't over yet, sir.",5
KERSH,"A.D. Skinner tells me our suspect's lying hospitalized in a coma and now, you're saying it's not over?",18
DOGGETT,We have no murder weapon... no forensic evidence. Unless we accept Tipet's own beliefs which you yourself characterize as preposterous...,20
KERSH,"It's over, Agent Doggett.",4
DOGGETT,We have no way of explaining how he killed any of these people.,13
KERSH,"I said it's over, Agent Doggett. I don't need every ""I"" dotted or every ""T"" crossed to know that we've got our man.",23
SCULLY'S ANSWERING MACHINE,This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message.,8
DOGGETT,"Agent Scully, I think we caught the guy who did it. But it... it still it... it just doesn't add up. It's the damnedest thing I ever saw. I know that this sounds strange, but there's a, there's a... part of me says what if... what if this guy was right? What if I shouldn't have let him die? I'm not making a whole lot of sense. Maybe I just need some sleep. If you get this message... and feel up to it... you give me a call.",88
DOGGETT,Is the Assistant Director in?,5
SKINNER,That'll be great. Thanks.,4
AGENT CRANE,"John. Excellent work out there, John. Just excellent.",8
SKINNER,Agent Doggett.,2
SKINNER,Is something wrong?,3
DOGGETT,I'm not sure... I'm awake.,5
SKINNER,"You think this is a dream? I mean, you standing here talking to me? All those people out there?",19
DOGGETT,"Last night I dreamt Tipet was inside my house holding an axe. I thought I woke up this morning. I thought I was awake, but-but then...",26
SKINNER,"Uh... What do you want me to do, pinch you? You're already awake.",13
DOGGETT,Stedman and Leeds must have experienced the same thing... all Tipet's victims. Everything seemed real but it was a dream... a dream that ended in their deaths.,27
SKINNER,"Anthony Tipet is in a coma, never to regain consciousness.",10
DOGGETT,He knows me now. He can enter in my dreams.,10
SKINNER,"Listen to me. You've had a tough couple days. You're tired. Go home, get some rest.",16
ANTHONY TIPET,She's going to die.,4
DOGGETT,I'm not going to let you do that.,8
ANTHONY TIPET,I'm sorry. I'm not going to kill her.,8
ANTHONY TIPET,You are.,2
SCULLY'S VOICE,Agent Doggett?,2
SCULLY,Agent Doggett. Hi.,3
DOGGETT,How'd you get here?,4
SCULLY,Your door was unlocked.,4
DOGGETT,"You just saved my life, Agent Scully.",7
SCULLY,"I just woke you up, Agent Doggett.",7
DOGGETT,Tipet's in my dreams. If you hadn't woken me up just now...,12
SCULLY,Anthony Tipet is dead. I got the call from Skinner on my way over here. He never regained consciousness.,19
DOGGETT,Are you okay?,3
SCULLY,"I seem to be, yes.",5
DOGGETT,"Well, if you need some more time off...",8
SCULLY,"No. I'm, um... I'm back at work now. That must have been some nightmare you just had.",17
DOGGETT,Tipet thought he'd find God by looking in the darkness inside himself.,12
SCULLY,You don't think he succeeded?,5
DOGGETT,"In my dreams, I see... I saw terrible... violent images that... scared the living daylights out of me. These things are a part of me. I can't deny that, but... maybe... maybe they didn't come from me.",37
SCULLY,Then where'd they come from?,5
SCULLY,"It was a bad dream, Agent Doggett, but that's all it was.",12
