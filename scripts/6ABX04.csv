MULDER,Milepost 134. Two miles to go.,6
SCULLY,"I'm all a-tingle. So, Mulder, this supposed clandestine source who's contacted you how do we know that he's not just another crackpot whose encyclopedic knowledge of extraterrestrial life isn't derived exclusively from reruns of Star Trek?",36
MULDER,Because of where this particular crackpot works. Groom Lake. Area 51. Where the military has conducted...,16
SCULLY,"… for the past 50 years, classified experiments involving extraterrestrial technology.",11
MULDER,It's all our questions. The proof that we've suspected but never been able to hold in our hands. That... that proof is here.,23
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's the dim hope of finding that proof that's kept us in this car, or one very much like it for more nights than I care to remember. Driving hundreds if not thousands of miles through neighborhoods and cities and towns where people are raising families and buying homes and playing with their kids and their dogs, and... in short, living their lives. While we - we - we just keep driving.",71
MULDER,What is your point?,4
SCULLY,Don't you ever just want to stop? Get out of the damn car? Settle down and live something approaching a normal life?,22
MULDER,This *is* a normal life.,5
SCULLY,Mulder.,1

MORRIS FLETCHER,FBI. You're going to have to turn around and leave immediately.,11
MULDER,Why? It's a public highway.,5
MORRIS FLETCHER,It also borders on a US Government testing ground. What's your business here? What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?,25
MULDER,What are you doing out here?,6
SCULLY,Hiding top secret test flights? Using technology from UFOs?,9
MORRIS FLETCHER,Flying saucers. I got a top secret for you. There's no such thing as flying saucers.,16

SOLDIER 1,"Your orders, sir?",3
HOWARD,Morris. Morris? What do you think you're doing?,8
HOWARD,Why'd you let them go?,5
HOWARD,"They were FBI agents obviously here to meet someone, very possibly an informant. You just sent away our best hope of finding out who.",24
JEFF,"We can't just disappear a couple of FBI agents, Howard. We'll get their own people to deal with them. That's what Morris was thinking. Right, Morry? Let's go.",28
GUARD,Sir.,1
GUARD,"Your identification, sir.",3
GUARD,You do have identification?,4
JEFF,What's Wegman doing here? Kind of late for the old man to be clocking in.,15
HOWARD,Something must be up. I'm going to check it out.,10
JEFF,Kiss-ass.,1
SCULLY,"Are you all right, Mulder?",5
SCULLY,"Well, you haven't said anything since we left those men on the highway. Is something wrong?",16

SCULLY,Mulder? Mulder...,2
JEFF,Bastard!,1
SCULLY,Hello?,1
SCULLY,Hello?! please?,2
SCULLY,Since when do you smoke? you?,6
JEFF,I ran a reverse trace on all the outgoing calls. We've definitely got a leak.,15
JEFF,He called the FBI this morning from Wegman's office.,9
JEFF,The leak! He used the guest phone in Wegman's office. He's rubbing our noses in it.,16
JEFF,In the fact that he works in this building. That he has access to everything-- all our work-- and we don't know who he is.,25
JEFF,Morris?,1
JEFF,You going to answer that? Oh. Yeah. Hello?,8
MRS. FLETCHER,What are you doing there?!,5
MRS. FLETCHER,It's midnight. I've been waiting up.,6
MRS. FLETCHER,"What do you mean, you didn't know? You said you'd call. Morris...",12

HOWARD,"It was a routine test flight, sir. The craft suddenly lost altitude at 2317 hours over highway 375.",18
GENERAL WEGMAN,What happened?,2
HOWARD,"We haven't yet determined that, sir. We have recovered the flight data recorder as well as the two pilots.",19
GENERAL WEGMAN,Alive?,1

GENERAL WEGMAN,My God.,2
HOWARD,"The other man's alive, but, uh...",6

SCULLY,"Yeah. ASSISTANT) Hi, there. How are you this morning?",9
KERSH'S ASSISTANT,"The Assistant Director is waiting, sir.",6
AD KERSH,"My two frequent flyers. I'm to understand you were in Nevada yesterday and after-- what's it been?-- Two, three conversations such as this on the matter.",26
SCULLY,"Well, sir...",2
AD KERSH,This morning I got a phone call from the Pentagon demanding that the two of you be reprimanded for trespassing on a top-secret military installation. What do you think you were doing there?,33
SCULLY,"We were following a lead, sir.",6
AD KERSH,And that's part of your current caseload? A legitimate investigation? source.,11
AD KERSH,What source?,2
MULDER,"Oh, if I had the name, I'd give it to you. Some whistle-blower working inside the so-called Area 51. Said he had some ""big deal"" information. I got to tell you... The whole thing turned out to be just one gigantic mistake on our part.",45
AD KERSH,"Agent Mulder, you were specifically ordered not to pursue any line of investigation pertaining to the X-Files.",17
MULDER,"Sir, you're absolutely right. And on behalf of Agent Scully and myself, I'd like to apologize for our blatant disregard of your direct order. You have our word. We will never ever do that again.",35
SCULLY,Mulder. Mulder!,2
SCULLY,What was that about?,4
SCULLY,"""I'd give you his name if I had it""? Whatever happened to protecting our contacts? Protecting our work?",18
SCULLY,What is going on with you?,6
SCULLY,"Mulder, you are acting bizarre.",5
MRS. FLETCHER,I can't believe you. I just can't believe you! And who is Scully?,13
MRS. FLETCHER,You could do me the courtesy of coming to bed. Pretend we have a happy marriage. What if Chris or Terry had come down here first? Seeing their father being a pervert! Did that ever occur to you? ne... Have you... Have you seen my car keys? I thought I might have left them...,54
TEENAGER,"Morning, Dad.",2
TEENAGER,"Oh, my God!",3
JOANNE FLETCHER,Morris... What did you do to Chris?,7
BOY,"Yo, dad.",2

MRS. FLETCHER,Morris! What about Chris?,4

JOANNE FLETCHER,Morris... You are wearing your suit from yesterday.,8
JOANNE FLETCHER,Morris... What are you doing?,5
JOANNE FLETCHER,It's for you.,3
JEFF,"Morry, it's Jeff. Where the hell are you?",8
JEFF,"Well, get your ass down here tout de suite. We got something big going down.",15
JEFF,Big as in I can't say anything more on the phone. Just get down here.,15
GENERAL WEGMAN,Do we know what he's saying?,6
HOWARD,"It seems he's praying, sir. We've identified the language-- a Native American dialect. Hopi, to be exact. The pilot's name is Captain Robert McDonough. Born in Missoula, Montana. No known foreign language skills. Only since the crash he claims to be one Mrs. Lana Chee a 75-year-old Hopi Indian woman born and raised on the Moapa Reservation about 35 miles from here.",62
GENERAL WEGMAN,Is it some kind of shell shock?,7
HOWARD,"We don't think so, sir. This is Mrs. Lana Chee.",10
HOWARD,We picked her up on the reservation this morning.,9
GENERAL WEGMAN,At ease.,2
GENERAL WEGMAN,What's your name?,3
HOPI INDIAN WOMAN,"Captain Robert McDonough, sir. I apologize for my present condition and appearing out of uniform, sir.",16
GENERAL WEGMAN,"Um... Do you know... What happened last night, Captain?",9
HOPI INDIAN WOMAN,"Sir, we launched from base at 2300 hours and headed south. At approximately 2315 we lost power in the right rear quadrant.",22
GENERAL WEGMAN,"Do you know what, uh... Do you know what caused the power loss?",13
HOPI INDIAN WOMAN,"No warning lights came up on the panel. All systems checked out in preflight. She just wasn't in the mood to fly, sir.",23
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
SCULLY,Scully.,1
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, who is this?",5
SCULLY,Mulder. something really weird happened last night when that UFO passed over us.,13
SCULLY,"UFO? Okay, the man that you're with, that's not me. His name is Morris Fletcher. He's an Area 51 employee.",20
SCULLY,"Morris Fletcher. think that I'm him, but I'm not. I'm me. I'm Mulder.",13
SCULLY,Psst. access but I'm going to need your help. What was that?,12
SCULLY,Uh... What was what?,4
SCULLY,"Mulder, uh... Where are you? as soon as you can.",10
SCULLY,How can I get in touch with you?,8
SCULLY,"That wasn't your source? Well, I'll run a trace. We don't want our collective asses chewed out all over again.",20
SCULLY,Mulder? Are you sure that's the best thing to do? panties on straight. We're federal officers... We go by the book.,21
RUDE ATTENDANT,That'll be $1.89. You get 11 cents change.,8
RUDE ATTENDANT,Wow. Maybe I'll just close early.,6
JEFF,"Turn around, big guy. We got trouble.",7
SOLDIER 1,Keep back! We got a spill!,6
SOLDIER 1,Sir!,1
HOWARD,"Hey, Fletcher! What the hell's he doing?",7
JEFF,"Fletcher, what are you doing?",5
JEFF,Holy mother of...,3
HOWARD,It's happened again.,3
HOWARD,Let's get out of here.,5
HOWARD,We got to help ourselves. Whatever caused this could come back.,11
JEFF,Morris...,1
HOWARD,What the hell's the matter with you?,7
JEFF,Morris …,2
HOWARD,I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Let's go.,9
HOWARD,Not anymore.,2
HOWARD,Burn it.,2
SOLDIER 1,"Clear perimeter, 200 feet! Let's go! All right, everybody, pull back!",11
JEFF,"Come on, Morry. That guy was dead long before we found him.",12
KERSH'S ASSISTANT,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,It's me.,2
SCULLY,What do you think you're doing?,6
SCULLY,We got the trace back on the call we received this morning. It came from a gas station pay phone off of highway 375 three miles east of Groom Lake.,30
SCULLY,And I'm thinking it was your source although I don't know why he'd try and impersonate you.,17
SCULLY,You don't think that we should follow up on this?,10
SCULLY,"Am I out of my mind? Mulder, you are out of your mind! What is up with you?! I'm thinking about having you examined for mental illness or-or drug use or... Or maybe a massive head injury! This is an X-File your life's work, your crusade!",46
HOWARD,This was brought to a local vet. Some kid found this in the desert ten miles east of the gas station.,21
GENERAL WEGMAN,Show me on the map.,5
HOWARD,Right here.,2
GENERAL WEGMAN,This is where you found the gas station attendant?,9
HOWARD,"Yes, sir. We located the pilot at the crash site here and the Indian woman right there.",17
GENERAL WEGMAN,What's this?,2
HOWARD,"That, we believe, is ground zero. Once we analyze the flight data recorder we hope to confirm it's where the warp began.",22
JEFF,"Beam me up, Scotty.",4
HOWARD,That's a tear in the space-time continuum an anomaly created by the malfunction of the aircraft which was operating in gravity pulse mode before it went down.,27
GENERAL WEGMAN,We've been flying these things since '53. I never heard of anything like this.,14
HOWARD,Anti-gravity systems utilize bends in space and time for propulsion. A sudden shift in a craft's trajectory could create the kind of distortion we're witnessing right here.,27
JEFF,"If this is where your so-called warp began we would have all seen it and the three of us were out on highway 375 at the time, sir intercepting two FBI agents.",32
HOWARD,"A lizard and a rock existing in the same time and space. The fact that none of us remembers seeing it is evidence that my theory is correct, sir.",29
JEFF,And how's that?,3
HOWARD,Lost time is a common symptom of close proximity to anti-gravity propulsion systems.,13
JEFF,"Then how come my head isn't in a rock, or Morris'?",11
HOWARD,That's one question I haven't been able to answer. It is possible we suffered consequences from our exposure that we're not fully aware of.,24
HOWARD,"That's your department-- keep it out of the paper, make sure the witnesses disappear. we get the lizard out of the rock?",22
HOWARD,Who says we can?,4
JOANNE FLETCHER,This is not a marriage. It's a farce.,8
JOANNE FLETCHER,"You're not attracted to me anymore. I disgust you, don't i? I-i-it's just that...",14
JOANNE FLETCHER,"It's just that you don't want to ever make love to me ever again, that's all. That and you mumble something about Scully in your sleep. Who is Scully, Morris? Is it another woman?",34
JOANNE FLETCHER,"Who is Scully? Tell me. past that there are things about my work that unfortunately, I have to keep a secret.",21
JOANNE FLETCHER,"Oh, no, buster. That's not going to fly this time. know about me. And... I've just... I've been under a lot of pressure lately. I mean, up is down and black is white. I don't know where I stand anymore. I don't even know... who I am really anymore. I just... I know for sure that I am not the man you married. I'm just not. And I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.",72
JOANNE FLETCHER,"Oh, god, Morris. I didn't know. They have that pill now. We can work this out. There's other ways to be intimate.",22
JOANNE FLETCHER,We can make this work.,5
JOANNE FLETCHER,Yes?,1
SCULLY,Hi. My name is Dana Scully. I'm looking for Morris Fletcher.,11
JOANNE FLETCHER,Morris!,1
JOANNE FLETCHER,You son of a bitch.,5
SCULLY,"I'm sorry. Uh, Morris Fletcher?",5
SCULLY,"You're, uh... You're the man from the other night? From Area 51?",12
JOANNE FLETCHER,Liar!,1
SCULLY,"You phoned me. Would you mind telling me what this is about? places, identities with this man Morris Fletcher the man that you think is Mulder, but he's not. Of course you don't believe me. Why was I expecting anything different? Your full name is Dana Katherine Scully. Your badge number is... Hell! I don't know your badge number. Your mother's name is Margaret. Your brother's name is Bill Jr. He's in the Navy and he hates me. Lately, for lunch, you've been having this six-ounce cup of yogurt, plain yogurt, into which you stir bee pollen because you're on a bee pollen kick even though I tell you you're a scientist and you should know better.",117
JOANNE FLETCHER,Cheater!,1
SCULLY,"Look... Any of that information could have been gathered by anyone. Scully. Well, it's good to know you haven't changed. That's somewhat comforting.",23
SCULLY,I don't know what the point of all of this is.,11
SCULLY,"No. You won't, but I wouldn't mind if you came clean with me. two nights ago. Fair enough?",18
JOANNE FLETCHER,I am calling the police!,5
SCULLY,"Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher. everything. Okay?",5
HOWARD,Howard Grodin. Mulder the Federal Bureau of Investigation. How are you this morning?,13
HOWARD,"How did you get this number? talk to you about. Sir, I am obligated to tell you that you have a security leak in your facility. A man with whom you've worked very closely has contacted this office on several occasions and offered me access to highly classified information.",49
HOWARD,Would you happen to have a name for this man?,10
SCULLY,Scully.,1
AD KERSH,You're in Nevada again.,4
SCULLY,"Uh... Sir, I am...",4
AD KERSH,"Do not speak, Agent. Listen. Your partner already apprised me of his conversation with the air force in his fervent desire to save you from making a fatal career mistake. Therefore, you will follow my instructions to the letter.",39
SCULLY,"Sir, I don't know what Agent Mulder might have told you, but I...",13
AD KERSH,"You will follow my instructions to the letter. Otherwise, don't bother coming back from Nevada.",15
ATTENDANT,Can I help you?,4
SCULLY,I'm sorry.,2
JEFF,"Damn it, Morris. this whole thing! He's not me, Scully! Would I do this?! Would I do this?! Scully...! Scully! truth! Scully, he's not me! He's not me! Scully! He's not me!",32
