SCULLY,"Jane Doe. Found last night entombed in a tenement wall by an agent who was following an anonymous tip. Time of death, approximately 2100 hours from three stab wounds to the abdomen. Dirt and clay were found under the nails of her right hand.",44
CADET 1,What are those lacerations on her arms and feet?,9
SCULLY,Predation-- from rats. The agent was led to her body by the sound of their feeding. Anyone?,17
CADET 1,She was killed someplace else. She clawed at the dirt before succumbing to her injuries.,15
SCULLY,That's possible. What else would help us I.D. This victim -- find the killer?,13
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,"It's obvious, isn't it?",4
SCULLY,What is?,2
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,"The chipped nail polish. The drugstore hair rinse. This is a single woman, unemployed. That's why no one's ID'd her. You found blood alcohol?",24
SCULLY,Point zero four.,3
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,She hooked up with the wrong man in a bar. He killed her. This man has killed before.,18
SCULLY,And you know that because...,5
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,"... that bruise beneath her ribs? It's from the hilt of a knife. The killer intended a single blow... the blade thrusting upward at a 45-degree angle into the heart, causing death instantly. But she struggled so, he missed. Then he got mad. Like I said... obvious.",46
DOGGETT,Agent Scully?,2
DOGGETT,You got something?,3
SCULLY,"Quite a lot, actually. We've identified your Jane Doe as Ellen Persich, 28, from Redland, Maryland.",16
REYES,How'd you make the I.D. So fast?,7
SCULLY,The bar that she was at last night is about a half a mile from where another woman was murdered two weeks ago apparently by the same killer.,28
REYES,You're saying the body John found was the second victim?,10
DOGGETT,This says that Rita Shaw was found in a ditch dead from a single knife wound. The woman I found was plastered behind a wall and stabbed three times.,29
SCULLY,"That's why I didn't make the connection at first, either but that was the lab on the phone and they confirmed that it was the same knife in both killings.",30
REYES,"Well, how did you make the connection?",7
SCULLY,I didn't but one of my students realized that the killer only meant to stab Agent Doggett's victim once. The other wounds were out of anger because he missed.,29
REYES,That's a pretty astute observation.,5
SCULLY,Amazingly so.,2
DOGGETT,This cadet have any other answers up his sleeve?,9
SCULLY,Like what?,2
DOGGETT,I want to know why someone tipped me off to this in the first place 'cause this isn't an X-File -- not by a long shot.,25
SCULLY,"I don't know, Agent Doggett, but now that you've got this case I'd say run with it.",17
DOGGETT,Cadet Hayes? Rudolph Hayes?,4
DOGGETT,I'm Agent Doggett. This is Agent Reyes.,7
DOGGETT,"Is that part of the training here, Cadet -- smelling body parts?",11
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,"This man's flesh smells of creosote... but his skin is soft. Untanned. He worked indoors. A hardware store, probably. The tear marks at his elbow go from left to right. He was broadsided in a car accident. His hands gripped the wheel so hard... his thumb bone snapped on impact.",50
DOGGETT,You determined all that just by looking at that arm?,10
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,I see things.,3
REYES,"We came to thank you. Because of your analysis, we were able to work up a profile to catch the man who murdered those women.",25
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,What's the profile?,3
DOGGETT,"White male, 25 to 35, ex-military. Employed near the bars where he met... why are you shaking your head?",19
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,The profile's wrong. Your killer is in his 40s. A felon recently arrived from out of state. His parole officer thinks he's looking for a job. He already has one -- working for organized crime. He's killed many people. He's going to keep on killing.,44
REYES,"Kind of annoying, isn't he?",5
REYES,John.,1
REYES,Nicholas Regali? I'm Agent Reyes; this is Agent Doggett.,9
NICHOLAS REGALI,"Oh, don't put them away so fast, Agents. I want to read them. John Jay... Dog... It.",17
NICHOLAS REGALI,Monica Reyes.,2
REYES,"Mr. Regali, you're in town in violation of the terms of your parole back in New York.",17
NICHOLAS REGALI,Call my parole officer. She'll tell you I'm here looking for work.,12
REYES,"You come here often, Mr. Regali? Like last night when Ellen Persich got murdered in the parking lot out back?",20
NICHOLAS REGALI,Last night. I don't remember.,5
REYES,"Maybe you remember being at The Bent Oak. Bartender says he saw you there two weeks ago. The same night a woman named Rita Shaw got stabbed in the heart. What do you have to say about that, Mr. Regali?",40
NICHOLAS REGALI,You folks don't know what you're dealing with.,8
NICHOLAS REGALI,"You don't want to play this game, flatfoot. Not with me.",11
REYES,"You like to kill women, Mr. Regali? You may think you can get away with it but that's not going to happen.",22
NICHOLAS REGALI,Like I said... you really don't know what you're dealing with.,11
DOGGETT,I think we do.,4
NICHOLAS REGALI,"Agent Dog... It, Agent Reyes.",5
DOGGETT,How long you been standing there?,6
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,Not long.,2
DOGGETT,"I'm glad you dropped by. Wanted to tell you we hit pay dirt with your profile. No arrests yet, but we're building our case.",24
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,There's something else.,3
DOGGETT,"There's another case I'd like you to take a look at. Seven-year- old boy rides his bike around the block. His mom's on the porch, counting his laps. He waves to her every time he goes by and after six laps, he doesn't come back around. She goes looking for him.",51
DOGGETT,Lying on the sidewalk. There's no witnesses no ransom demands no clue as to who took him or why. The cops search door-to-door block-to-block for two days. Nothing. No news at all. And after three days they find him in a field.,42
DOGGETT,It's all in here. The particulars... about my son.,9
DOGGETT,I've been over this I don't know how many times but after nine years there's not a lot to go on. You were such a big help yesterday. If there's anything you see here...,34
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,"Agent Doggett, that case I helped you with yesterday? That is your son's.",13
DOGGETT,What is this?,3
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,Unsolved murders. I started collecting them before I came to the FBI. I couldn't tell you why.,17
DOGGETT,What do you do with these?,6
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,If I sit with them for a long time very quietly they tell me things.,15
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,It's how I see what I see.,7
DOGGETT,You've been following my son's case.,6
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,For a long time. He calls to me.,8
DOGGETT,"Cadet, you should know there's a real good chance you're nuts.",11
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,You recognize that man?,4
DOGGETT,It's Bob Harvey. It's the closest we ever had to a suspect.,12
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,He died. Killed in a car crash last year in New Orleans.,12
DOGGETT,This man killed my son?,5
CADET RUDOLPH HAYES,He took him. He didn't kill him.,7
DOGGETT,Are you saying the same man that killed those women killed my son? This guy Regali?,16
DOGGETT,Assistant Director? Can I have a minute?,7
AD BRAD FOLLMER,It's not a good time. I'm off to a meeting with the Director.,13
DOGGETT,This can't wait.,3
AD BRAD FOLLMER,And the Director can?,4
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Okay, you've got one minute.",5
DOGGETT,"When you were in New York, you worked the organized crime task force, right?",14
AD BRAD FOLLMER,Mm-hmm.,1
DOGGETT,Did you ever hear of a guy named Nicholas Regali?,10
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Yeah, he was... a collector a low-level thug. Why are you asking me, Agent Doggett?",15
DOGGETT,When the New York office was investigating my son's death his name never came up.,15
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Well, why would it? You have reason to believe he was involved?",12
DOGGETT,"I've got no evidence but somebody's telling me he's mixed-up with the suspect in my son's kidnapping, this Bob Harvey.",20
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Well, I never heard that. And I'm sure I'd remember.",10
AD BRAD FOLLMER,You want me to ask around and pull some files?,10
AD BRAD FOLLMER,I'll see what I can find.,6
DOGGETT,I'd appreciate it.,3
REYES,John! Where you been?,4
DOGGETT,Chasing down leads.,3
REYES,"We were supposed to meet in the office this morning, remember? To go over what we have on Regali.",19
DOGGETT,"I think this guy, Regali may have been involved in Luke's death.",12
REYES,What? Since when?,3
DOGGETT,Since I've been talking to Cadet Hayes. He says Regali knew Bob Harvey -- that they were in on it together.,20
REYES,How could he possibly know that?,6
DOGGETT,How does he know half the stuff he knows? I did some digging. I found out that Bob Harvey and Regali both did time at Walkill in 1988.,28
REYES,So did a thousand other men. That doesn't mean they knew each other.,13
DOGGETT,"I tracked Regali's credit card use, Monica. The day Luke disappeared he gassed his car up two miles from my house.",21
REYES,Regali is a New Yorker. A lot of New Yorker's visit Long Island.,13
REYES,This is not evidence not even close.,7
REYES,"I will never know how badly it hurt you to lose your son or how much pain you still carry. I understand how much you want to find his killer, but I don't want to see you disappointed. Not again.",40
DOGGETT,It's not going to happen. Not this time.,8
DOGGETT,"Hi, Barbara. How you doing?",5
DOGGETT,When'd you get the new furniture?,6
BARBARA DOGGETT,Last year. I just wanted to make a change.,9
DOGGETT,It looks great. You look great.,6
BARBARA DOGGETT,"You need to call first, John. Kind of throws me when you just show up here.",16
DOGGETT,"I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I need to talk to you, Barb.",13
BARBARA DOGGETT,It's about Luke.,3
DOGGETT,I got a suspect.,4
BARBARA DOGGETT,"Oh, god. John...",3
DOGGETT,"I know, I know. But this time, it's different.",9
BARBARA DOGGETT,"Is it? He ""could"" be, he ""might"" be... I want to find out who did this just as badly as you do. But I don't want you coming over here again unless you know... unless you absolutely know.",38
BARBARA DOGGETT,That's what I thought.,4
DOGGETT,"Look, this guy may have been cruising the neighbourhood. You could have seen him.",14
BARBARA DOGGETT,Did you hear anything I said?,6
BARABA DOGGETT,Agent Scully? I'm Barbara. John's ex-wife.,6
SCULLY,Hi. I'm Dana. Nice to meet you.,7
BARBARA DOGGETT,He said you'd be coming by.,6
SCULLY,You weren't able to make an identification?,7
BARBARA DOGGETT,I didn't expect to.,4
BARBARA DOGGETT,You know he doesn't think clearly about this. He can't.,10
SCULLY,He blames himself.,3
BARBARA DOGGETT,"He thinks he failed Luke. In his mind, he can never do enough, never suffer enough for what happened. I think if you can help him find the man who did this maybe he could move on.",37
BARBARA DOGGETT,He and Monica could really have something together. He just won't let her in.,14
BARBARA DOGGETT,They're letting him go?,4
DOGGETT,For now.,2
BARBARA DOGGETT,I'll be at my mom's till tomorrow.,7
DOGGETT,Tell me you got something.,5
SCULLY,"As you asked, I compared the wounds inflicted on your son with the wounds on these two women.",18
DOGGETT,And?,1
SCULLY,There are similarities between the trajectory of the wounds and the force with which they were delivered.,17
DOGGETT,Meaning Regali's the guy.,4
SCULLY,"Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction on Cadet Hayes's part. But that's all it is. The killer used different weapons, he demonstrated no consistent M.O, and no clear victimology.",31
REYES,None of it will hold up in court.,8
DOGGETT,"Well, something out there will.",5
DOGGETT,Something's not right.,3
REYES,What do you mean?,4
DOGGETT,"Here's a guy whose name comes up in connection with racketeering, prostitution, drugs, even murder, yet all he's got are nickel and dime convictions. Always gets off with just a slap on the wrist.",34
REYES,You know as well as I do mob cases are hard to build.,13
DOGGETT,What I'm saying is I don't think anyone's even trying. I think this guy Regali's greasing somebody.,17
REYES,As in bribery?,3
DOGGETT,What else could it be?,5
DOGGETT,What? What is it?,4
AD BRAD FOLLMER,Agents. I was just coming to see you.,8
REYES,"We need to talk to you, Assistant Director. About New York.",11
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Oh, didn't you get the case files?",7
REYES,I mean when we were working in the New York office. You and me.,14
AD BRAD FOLLMER,I'm not following.,3
REYES,I used to get take out from a place on 11th street. A little hole- in-the-wall. Maybe you remember it. Carlo's.,21
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Is it me, or, uh is this becoming an odd conversation?",11
REYES,"One night, three years ago, I'm waiting for my order. I wandered toward the kitchen.",15
REYES,And I saw you.,4
AD BRAD FOLLMER,Me?,1
REYES,"Talking to a man. A mob guy. I saw you take money from him, Brad. A stack of it.",19
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Three years ago? So, instead of asking me to explain it or even reporting me to the bureau you broke off our relationship and moved away?",26
REYES,"I cared about you, Brad. I'm not defending my actions.",10
AD BRAD FOLLMER,And now you've come here because you think I'm on the take. Maybe I was on the take when Agent Doggett's son was murdered.,24
DOGGETT,Somebody gave Regali inside help. Covered his role in my son's death.,12
AD BRAD FOLLMER,The man you saw me with was a confidential informant. I was giving him the money.,16
REYES,That's not what happened.,4
AD BRAD FOLLMER,We were buying his help to infiltrate a crime family. It's all documented. The entire operation.,16
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Now I can prove what I'm saying. Can you? You should have come to me, Monica. Especially given what I know now.",22
DOGGETT,What do you know?,4
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"When you raised concerns about Regali I looked into the source of these allegations -- uh, a cadet, right?",18
DOGGETT,Rudolph Hayes. He's been very helpful in this investigation.,9
AD BRAD FOLLMER,Rudolph Hayes died in 1978 in a car accident.,9
DOGGETT,What? Let me see that.,5
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Cadet Hayes's real name is Stuart Mimms of Mendota, Minnesota. Last known residence the Dakota County Psychiatric Facility.",18
REYES,He was a mental patient?,5
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic voluntarily institutionalized in 1990. In 1992, he checked himself out and disappeared. There's another thing. We can also place him in New York city in 1993... the year your son was murdered.",35
NICHOLAS REGALI,Nice car. I remember when they had you banging around in a ten-year-old Impala. Now look at you. Mr. Assistant Director.,21
AD BRAD FOLLMER,You got lucky. He has another suspect.,7
NICHOLAS REGALI,You came down here to tell me that?,8
AD BRAD FOLLMER,There's something I need to know. Were you in any way involved in the death of John Doggett's son?,19
NICHOLAS REGALI,Since when do you ask me questions?,7
AD BRAD FOLLMER,Were you involved!,3
NICHOLAS REGALI,Course not. What kind of guy do you think I am?,11
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"That's it, I'm done, Regali.",5
NICHOLAS REGALI,Done?,1
AD BRAD FOLLMER,"With you, with this, with this whole thing.",8
NICHOLAS REGALI,"And if I say no, what are you going to do? You know, if I'm you, right now I'm thinking ""I could bop this guy right here and who's going to know it's not self defence?"" Well, let me remind you anything happens to me a videotape lands at the Washington Post showing a young Brad Follmer taking cash from yours truly to make an indictment go away. You're done when I say you're done.",75
SCULLY,It's all in there. How you defrauded the FBI with a false identity in order to gain admittance to the Academy. We know who you really are. We know about your history with schizophrenia. We know that you orchestrated this entire thing in order to get close to Agent Doggett.,50
RUDOLPH HAYES,I've been recognized by Agent Doggett's ex-wife who failed to identify Nicholas Regali in that same room yesterday.,18
SCULLY,Because Nicholas Regali did not kill Agent Doggett's son. You did.,11
RUDOLPH HAYES,That's one explanation.,3
DOGGETT,It's the explanation.,3
RUDOLPH HAYES,No.,1
DOGGETT,Then what is? What is?!,5
RUDOLPH HAYES,"I told you before, Agent Doggett. I studied the photos of your son's death. They called to me. I don't know why, but it was a message, and I listened.",30
SCULLY,"And then, you killed Agent Doggett's son.",7
RUDOLPH HAYES,"I studied his case obsessively. I'm a schizophrenic. That's what schizophrenics do. Obsess. I watched Agent Doggett. I watched his ex- wife, too. She can't tell you how she recognizes me just that she does.",35
DOGGETT,You're a liar. You lied to the FBI. You're lying now.,11
RUDOLPH HAYES,"Would you have listened to me otherwise? A mental patient with insight into your son's death? I wanted to get close to you, Agent Doggett. To help you.",28
DOGGETT,You gave me that tip. To find the woman's body in the wall.,13
RUDOLPH HAYES,Regali associated with the man who abducted your son. I called you so that you could catch him.,18
RUDOLPH HAYES,I've received another message. I'd like to go back home now to the institution.,14
REYES,John? John!,2
SCULLY,"Well, he told us his story. Whether it's true...",9
REYES,"In other words, we're nowhere. Again.",6
NICHOLAS REGALI,"Well, well. It's the FBI agent.",6
DOGGETT,I'm not here as an FBI agent. I'm here as a father.,12
NICHOLAS REGALI,Whoa. What could that mean?,5
DOGGETT,I want to know what happened to my son.,9
NICHOLAS REGALI,"I don't know who killed your son. But I like you, FBI. I really do. I'll tell you how it could have happened, hypothetically.",24
NICHOLAS REGALI,"Say there was this guy - a businessman. And say this businessman -- in the course of doing business -- has to associate with any number of thugs, sickos, perverts. Like Bob Harvey, for example. And say this Bob Harvey likes little boys. Yeah. Disgusting. Say one day, Bob Harvey sees a little boy riding a bike, and he can't stand it. He grabs the boy. So, Harvey takes the boy back to his place only he doesn't tell the businessman what he's doing. So, the businessman walks in on him. You see what I'm saying, FBI? The boy sees the businessman's face. The businessman who never did nothing to this little boy. That's a problem. Well... every problem has got a solution, right?",121
WOMAN,"Oh, my God. He shot him. He just took out his gun and shot him.",15
