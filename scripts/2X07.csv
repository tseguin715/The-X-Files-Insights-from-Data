LORE,Damn. There’s ash in the wine from the fires in Malibu Canyon. You can almost see from here.,18
LORE,"I want you to know I … I don’t do this. I mean, I’m not one of those guys that sends his family on vacation just so he can … but when I met you at the corporate party, I …",41
WOMAN,Shh. It’ll be worth it. I’ll do things with you no one’s ever done.,14
LORE,Ouch!,1
DETECTIVE MUNSON,Let’s start in the bedroom and work our way downstairs.,10
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Don’t let the media in on the writings in blood on the wall.,13
DETECTIVE MUNSON,Okay.,1
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Excuse me, sir? If I can ask your indulgence? This is a restricted crime scene.",15
MULDER,Agent Mulder. I’m with the Bureau.,6
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Nobody called the Bureau.,4
MULDER,They should have.,3
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Look, LAPD’s seen, I don’t know, what? Maybe a couple of weird crime scenes down the years. I think we can handle things.",23
MULDER,"There’s no time for agency rivalries. I don’t care about credit for the arrest or what goes on whose record. In the past year these killers have murdered six people in two states. They only kill at night. By the end of the week, two more people will be dead and they will be gone.",55
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Just how do you know all this?,7
MULDER,There’s a file on the previous murders. I’ve studied it. I’ve studied them. I’ve been waiting three months for them to reappear.,22
DETECTIVE NETTLES,And just how can you be sure that these are the same killers?,13
MULDER,"The wire reported a body was found drained of blood, bite marks on the exterior jugular and median cubital veins. Every mirror in the house was smashed.",27
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Yeah, well, it’s what the wire didn’t report that distinguishes this scene.",12
MULDER,There’s writings on the wall written in the victim’s blood.,10
MULDER,"""He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day."" They have the same feeble grasp of the Bible as all those big-haired preachers do. The victim – was he a father?",47
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Yeah. Three boys. The family’s been notified.,7
MULDER,"In Memphis, they murdered James Ellis, 58, father of Ellis and Sons Clothiers. The second victim was a Korean woman -- Linda Sun. The third victim was a Jesuit Theologian. Excuse me. In Portland, three months ago the first victim was a priest. The second victim was the only son of a family of six children. The last victim was the owner of a new age book shop --- The Holy Spirit. I believe that’s how they perceive themselves, as a kind of Unholy Trinity. They use these to extract blood and store it for a quick fix later. Their need is insatiable, but murdering for blood risks exposure and capture. If my profile of the previous cases holds true, they’ve been living in the city and working near blood products for the past month.",133
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Look, Agent Mulder, look I’m really sorry I was such a hard ass back there. In this town, it’s really tough to trust anyone. Truth is, I’d be happy to have you work on our investigation. Now this is Detective Gwen ----",41
MULDER,I’m working alone.,3
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"An FBI Agent without a partner? Look, Mulder, our department’s under a crisis alert right now because of the fires in the canyon. The fact is, I don’t think I can free up any resources for you.",37
MULDER,I only need one thing.,5
VOICE,Hollywood Blood Bank.,3
MULDER,"Yeah, hi. This is Marty Mulder from your payroll service. I have a question regarding the W -4 form of a recent employee.",23
VOICE,You mean Frank?,3
MULDER,When was he hired?,4
VOICE,Couple of weeks ago. He's the night watchman.,8
MULDER,Federal Agent!,2
MAXWELL,"Easy, man, easy! Sorry, man. I didn’t know you were there. Damn freak night watchman always breaking the light bulbs.",20
MAXWELL,I’ll wait upstairs.,3
MULDER,Federal Agent! Freeze!,3
"JOHN, THE SON",Turn off the lights! Turn them off! You’re killing me! Turn them off! Turn them off! Please!,17
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Tell us your real name.,5
"JOHN, THE SON",I can’t take it! Turn off the lights!,8
"JOHN, THE SON",You’re killing me! Turn them off! Please! Turn off the lights! Please! Turn them off! Turn them off!,18
MULDER,That better?,2
"JOHN, THE SON",I’ll only talk to him.,5
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Lucky you.,2
"JOHN, THE SON",You know what we are.,5
MULDER,What are you?,3
"JOHN, THE SON","He is the Father, I am the Son, and she is the Unholy Spirit.",14
MULDER,And the three of you killed Garret Lore.,8
"JOHN, THE SON",No.,1
MULDER,Your fingerprints were found at the crime scene.,8
"JOHN, THE SON","No. When a snake eats a fly, it’s not murder. It just is.",13
MULDER,Frogs eat flies. Are you dead?,6
"JOHN, THE SON",I never will be.,4
MULDER,Do you believe that?,4
"JOHN, THE SON",Don’t you want to live forever?,6
MULDER,"Well, not if drawstring pants come back into style.",9
"JOHN, THE SON","Look, what nobody realizes is that there is no afterlife. I know this. Listen, listen, I know this because when we prolong our lives by taking theirs all I see is such … horror in their eyes and that’s because at that moment they’re face-to-face with death and then suddenly they realize there’s nothing else. There’s no heaven. There’s no soul. There’s just rot and there’s just decay. And I will never, ever, ever, ever have to face that.",79
MULDER,"It’s a stiff price, though. Look at yourself – drinking blood, living in darkness, unable to see your reflection in a mirror. Or is that just a myth?",28
"JOHN, THE SON","I can’t be seen in a mirror. Look… anything worth anything has a price and when I’m standing next to your deathbed looking as young as I look right now and I see that fear in your eyes at the moment of death … then, then tell me the price is too stiff.",53
MULDER,It’s more likely I’ll be looking in your eyes at the moment before they lead you into the gas chamber. That’s a moment you won’t have to face if you tell me where the others are.,36
"JOHN, THE SON",Why would I? They’re the only ones that can kill me.,11
MULDER,"Well, if you are what you say you are, I know what can kill you.",15
MULDER,"It’d be easy to cover those windows. Just tell me where the other two are. In another couple of hours, there’ll be no escaping the sun…. Son.",27
MULDER,"If he wants to talk, cover the windows and call me.",11
DETECTIVE MUNSON,What if he turns into a bat and flies out through the bars?,13
MULDER,"That man is clearly delusional but I get the sense that not even he believes his claims. For now, we’ve got to play along with his beliefs. I’m hoping the sunlight will give him an excuse to talk.",38
DETECTIVE MUNSON,Why don’t you go back to your hotel and get some sleep.,12
MULDER,I didn’t check into a hotel room. I don’t sleep anymore.,11
GUARD,"Number four, right away!",4
GUARD,"Number four, right away!",4
DR. BROWNING,"An edema ball at the nostrils. Rupture of the skull due to internal steam pressure … these are indications of long term exposure to extreme temperatures, not a sunburn for 15 seconds.",32
MULDER,The guards found no flammable materials? I had believed that this man’s illness was psychological.,15
DR. BROWNING,There is a condition known as Gunther’s Disease – congenital erythropoietic porphyria creating cutaneous photosensitivity.,15
MULDER,"I’m familiar with porphyria. It’s an affliction which causes lesions and blisters when skin is exposed to sunlight, not fourth degree burns. Sufferers may have a hema deficiency which can be supplemented by a small ingestion of blood, not the kind of bloodthirst this man had. It’s probably ignorance of porphyria as a disease that led to the creation of vampire myths in Asia in the Middle Ages. I had dismissed the possibility of the actual existence of such a creature as myth.",83
DR. BROWNING,You are really upsetting me. On several levels.,8
MULDER,When will you get the blood tests back?,8
DR. BROWNING,Next week.,2
MULDER,What’s this purple stain here?,5
DR. BROWNING,Could be an ink stamp like they give at a party or a club.,14
MULDER,Can you read it?,4
DR. BROWNING,It is possible that the heat burned the ink permanently into the lower levels of the skin.,17
GUARD’S DESK AND HOLDS IT OVER THE HAND,) An old coroner’s trick.,4
MULDER,I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear.,10
KRISTEN,Are you about to ask what a normal person like me is doing in a place like this?,18
MULDER,How do you define normal?,5
KRISTEN,Risha .. Red wine. I don’t. How do you?,8
MULDER,"I don’t. All I know is, uh .. normal is not what I feel.",13
KRISTEN,"You’ve lost someone. Not a lover, a friend. I’ll get these.",11
MULDER,He who drinks my blood…,5
KRISTEN,…shall have eternal life. You’re not interested in this place … in what we do.,15
MULDER,How do you know?,4
KRISTEN,"You’re afraid of me. I take the life of others … inside me, into my blood.",16
MULDER,I need to know.,4
KRISTEN,"All day long I deal with equity notes, bonds, nothing that’s real. This gives my life… life. My name’s Kristen. It’s a normal name.",24
MULDER,AIDS. Aren’t you afraid?,4
KRISTEN,I wish I could die.,5
MULDER,Father. The Sun.,3
YUNG,"I don’t know who you are, Freak, but we’re two consenting adults. Now, get the hell out of here.",19
YUNG,Kristen? Kristen? Kristen? Come out. It’s my turn.,8
YUNG,Don’t worry. I took care of that guy. I told you I’d protect you.,14
DETECTIVE MUNSON,The murderers cut off the power supply at some point and the phone. Fits their MO.,16
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Agent Mulder, this is our forensic dentist you requested – Dr. Jacobs.",12
DR. JACOBS,How do you do.,4
MULDER,"I don’t want to bias your report, but I need a preliminary examination for anything … unnatural.",17
DR. JACOBS,Uh huh. Shine the light down here.,7
DETECTIVE MUNSON,Agent Mulder. All this time I’ve been putting raspberry sauce on ice cream.,13
MULDER,Check these prints immediately. One will be the victim’s. The other should be the woman we’re looking for.,18
DR. JACOBS,"Well, the bites are not done by an animal. These are human. And, realize this is a cursory exam, but I’d say they were made by three different people.",29
SEX,F HAIR :BL EYES:,4
RESTR,"None There are two previous addresses. 164 Valley View Dr. Portland, Oregon 97223 4057 Sweetgum Lane Memphis, Tennessee 88161 MULDER looks at the files of the murders that were committed in each of those cities.)",35
MULDER,The Unholy Spirit.,3
DETECTIVE MUNSON,"We’ve got the front. You guys go around back. You, check the garage. Okay. Do it. Open her up.",19
DETECTIVE NETTLES,Miss Kilar? Los Angeles Police Department. We have a warrant to search the premises.,14
DETECTIVE MUNSON,I found these. Veterinary needles. Size matches the puncture wounds of the previous victims. This is from a snake bit kit. It’s placed over the wound to extract poison. Only this one …,33
MULDER,Has blood in it.,4
DETECTIVE NETTLES,"Well, she wasn’t at work, and she’s not here.",9
MULDER,"She’s gone, and she’s not coming back.",7
MULDER,Special Agent Fox Mulder. Federal Bureau of Investigation. They’re after you.,11
KRISTEN,How do you know?,4
MULDER,The bread. Legends in Eastern European countries. It’s said that one can protect oneself eating bread filled with blood. You were protecting yourself.,23
KRISTEN,And now you’re protecting me?,5
MULDER,I think it’s best if I took you into protective custody. They’ll kill once more. They’ll try to kill you.,20
KRISTEN,Why are you here alone? Because you think you’re not afraid? Because you need to know. You need to know they are who you believe they are.,27
MULDER,What I believe you to be.,6
KRISTEN,One change in the wind and the fires will move this way. Have you ever tasted blood? No. You haven’t. Blood tastes … dangerous. It’s sweet and thick.,28
MULDER,You were in Memphis and Portland when the other murders occurred. How are you connected?,15
KRISTEN,"When I was a little girl, my father my father beat me. ""Abused"" is too frail a word. He showed his love for me by beating me. I was dead. One night, he hit me so hard he knocked out two teeth, then locked me in my room. The blood poured from my mouth onto the floor and down my throat. It was the only way I knew I was alive. I met John in Chicago. You know him as ""The Son."" He also beat me. I guess that's the way it works sometimes. He hit me once and cut open my lip. I was angry. As revenge, I jumped on him and I bit through his lip. He tasted my blood. And I tasted his. After that, we were into blood sports. But... I never... I lost him. One night he came home with two others and it turned... unnatural. I left him and I moved to Memphis.",159
MULDER,But they followed you. They want you.,7
KRISTEN,I’m tired of running. And you’re here to protect me.,10
KRISTEN,You trying to ward me off?,6
MULDER,That’s from someone I lost.,5
KRISTEN,"Well, I hope you find her.",6
MULDER,"The one you lost, John, he’s … dead. But they’ve picked up another. They’re three again. Kristen, you’ll be safer if you come back to the police station with me.",30
KRISTEN,"Without him, they won’t come for me. I won’t go.",10
MULDER,Then I won’t go.,4
KRISTEN,You need to get cleaned up.,6
MULDER,Yeah?,1
MULDER,No mirrors.,2
KRISTEN,I don’t like the way I look.,7
MULDER,That makes this hard.,4
KRISTEN,I’ll do it.,3
MULDER,It’s not who you are. It doesn’t make you happy.,10
"JOHN, THE SON","I've been watching. I had to wait for you to finish. I had to wait to tell you. It's true. I was as surprised as anybody. You can live forever. Everybody else just dies but we... We come back. The spirit showed me. And now she'll show you. We live in a different world, Kristen, and nobody on the outside can end my life. You can't kill me but I can kill you. I know, Kristen, what I did to you was... if I were to die I would certainly go to hell for what I did, but I love you and I can atone for eternity. Kill him... and we'll be together. You've got to drink the blood of his spirit.",122
KRISTEN,But he’s not …,4
"JOHN, THE SON","No, no. He is. A spirit is one who believes. He knows we're possible. You don't have much time before the sun comes up. Cut him open... and we'll finish.",30
KRISTEN,You have to go.,4
MULDER,Are they here?,3
KRISTEN,The fire. You have to go.,6
MULDER,My car’s down the hill.,5
KRISTEN,Mine’s in the garage. The keys are in it.,9
MULDER,You have to get your things.,6
KRISTEN,I’ll be right there.,4
KRISTEN,He’s not dead! John’s alive. I saw him.,8
MULDER,Come on.,2
MULDER,Are you all right?,4
KRISTEN,I won’t leave without him.,5
MULDER,I’ll go.,2
"JOHN, THE SON",We’ll rise up! You can’t kill us! You’re not one of us!,12
KRISTEN,But I will be. I’m tasting the blood of a believer.,11
"JOHN, THE SON",But you haven’t taken a life.,6
KRISTEN,I’ll take mine.,3
"JOHN, THE SON",Don’t do that! Don’t do that! Don’t! Don’t! Don’t! No! No! No!,12
FIREMAN,Agent Mulder. I’m sorry. We found four bodies – all dead.,11
MULDER,The remains?,2
FIREMAN,The fire was extremely hot. It’s just ashes and bones.,10
