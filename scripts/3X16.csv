MAN,"The navy...wanted to hear my story. They said, I owed it to the dead, to tell them the truth. I told them where to stick the truth. I'm the last man who knows who killed the men aboard that submarine, who knows it was a suicide mission but I'll burn in hell before I tell the murderers who sent us there. your story, to make sure that justice is served. up with your captain.",74
MAN,Johansen did what he had to. That's war. Some are sacrificed so that others can live.,16
MAN,You gotta get us outta here!,6
MAN (VOICE OVER),"But when that door shut, I knew my life, all our lives have just been sacrificed.",16
SANFORD,Johansen! Open this door! Open this door! Johansen!,8
MAN (VOICE OVER),"For the 1st time, I saw the enemy who was killing us.",12
MAN (VOICE OVER),"That thing was causing the slow, painful deaths.",8
MAN,"And I prayed, one of the Japanese depth charges would finish the job. of some sort.",16
MAN,"The navy says we were sent to recover an A-bomb. That's why we got all these burns. Gimme a freaking break. Whatever it was, we were sent to guard it.",30
MAN,"Before it slithered away, back to where it came from, back into the sea, back into who knows what.",19
MAN,"That thing... is still down there! The navy will deny it... but you've got to make sure the truth gets out. I can trust you to do that, can't I Mr. Mulder?",32

THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN,You can trust all of us.,6
SCULLY,"Excuse me, where can I find Walter Skinner? He was brought in with a gunshot wound.",16
FULLER,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,Agent Fuller.,2
FULLER,This is agent Caleca we got a call from the DC police.,12
SCULLY,How bad is he?,4
FULLER,We don't know. He's been in surgery.,7
SCULLY,What happened?,2
CALECA,Looked like some hot-head drew a gun in a coffee shop. Skinner happened to be in the way.,18
SCULLY,What do we have on the shooter?,7
FULLER,"We have a description from the waitress. A handgun was recovered in the parking lot, unregistered, no prints. Our guys got 2 partials off the cash register.",27
SCULLY,Hair and fiber?,3
FULLER,This just happened a few hours ago.,7
SCULLY,This is the assistant director who's been shot. We have to make all resources available.,15
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
SCULLY,How is he? pain.,4
SKINNER (WHISPERING),I've seen him before... the man who shot me.,9
MULDER,Give me the key.,4
KRYCEK,When we get there.,4
MULDER,"I wanna make sure we get there together, give it to me.",12
KRYCEK,When we get there.,4
FULLER,How's he doing?,3
SCULLY,"He's on steady Demerol, he's in and out. I thought I asked for guards to be posted outside.",18
CALECA,We put in a request with the DC police.,9
SCULLY,This wasn't a random shooting. I want guards posted here and I want them here now!,16
FULLER,I think it's a matter of pulling men on something else.,11
SCULLY,I've heard the excuses. I don't care if you and agent Caleca have to stand in the hallway yourself. This man has to be protected. Okay?,26
MULDER,We're being followed. A dark sedan with its lights off. It was parked on the shoulder about half a mile back. Speed up. Speed up!,25
KRYCEK,I don't have it.,4
SCULLY,I got a message you called.,6
MAN,"Good morning, we found something I knew you wanted to see ASAP.",12
SCULLY,It's on the shooter?,4
MAN,"Yeah, the partial prints we pulled out of the cash register didn't add up to anything. We found saliva on Skinner's shirt that wasn't his. This is an analysis of the secretors and other hemofactors.",35
SCULLY,"Which tells us we're looking for a male, probably in his 40s with blood type B positive, but we already know all that from the waitress' description.",27
MAN,There's more. We were able to chromosome-stain some of the hair fibers we picked up last night.,17
SCULLY,We still gotta find the guy before we can get a match.,12
MAN,We can still run those indicators against all the suspects arrested in the DC area in the last couple of years.,21
SCULLY,"This takes too much time. You know what, run them anyway. Can I borrow you this for a little while?",20
MAN,Go ahead.,2
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
CSM,"What's the prognosis? rapid effect on cellular activity, giving rise to the onset of massive and malignant cancers.",18
CSM,"Has anyone been in to see these men? looks through the bandages of the sick man, his eyes still move). But I think we should get a specialist in here because, frankly, I've never seen anything like this before.",39
CSM,I have.,2
CSM,Have the bodies destroyed.,4
CSM,Isn't that the prognosis?,4
MULDER,Guess I'm not dead.,4
SCULLY,What happened?,2
MULDER,Maybe you can tell me.,5
SCULLY,The State police found you unconscious. You were strapped in the passenger's seat of a rental car that had been driven into a ditch.,24
MULDER,We were run off the road by 2 men.,9
SCULLY,"Who's ""we""?",2
MULDER,Krycek.,1
SCULLY,Krycek?,1
MULDER,"He was in Hong Kong, he's got the digital tape. He's been selling information.",14
SCULLY,Is that what the men wanted?,6
MULDER,They ordered him out of the car. I thought they were going to kill him. I though they were going to kill us both. And then there was this bright flash. That's all I remember.,35
SCULLY,"Well it may not be the best time to tell you but, you're not the only one in the hospital. Skinner's been shot.",23
MULDER,What's his condition?,3
SCULLY,A bullet perforated his small intestine. The doctor seems to think he'll be fine.,14
MULDER,Who shot him?,3
SCULLY,I'm not sure. But I have an idea.,8
MULDER,What are those?,3
SCULLY,PCR results this one belongs to the man who shot Skinner.,11
MULDER,Yeah and who's this one belong to?,7
SCULLY,The man who shot Melissa.,5
WELL-MANICURED MAN,How could they have gotten information about that location? denied any involvement.,12
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Well they got those coordinates somehow.,6
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Has our associate in Washington looked into this? think any of us would have anticipated.,15
WELL-MANICURED MAN,How do you mean? and explain it himself.,8
SCULLY,"Hi, how are you feeling?",5
SKINNER,Like someone's been inside my stomach redecorating. What have you turned up on the shooter?,15
SCULLY,We've determined that the man who shot you was the same man who shot my sister.,16
SKINNER,"I bet you had to work to get that, huh?",10
SCULLY,"Yes I did, you don't seem surprised.",7
SKINNER,"3 men came to see me a few days ago, they warned me about pursuing your sister's murder investigation.",19
SCULLY,Do you realize what you're saying sir?,7
SKINNER,I'm not advancing any conspiracy theory here Scully.,8
SCULLY,"You're saying, that they closed down my sister's case not because of lack of evidence but because they didn't want us to catch the killer.",25
SKINNER,You should be very careful about the accusations that you make.,11
SCULLY,The man who shot you.. you said that you've seen him before.,12
SKINNER,"Several months ago, he was one of the men who attacked me in the stairway,with Krycek.",16
SCULLY,He was working with Krycek?,5
SKINNER,They're the ones who stole the digital tape from me.,10
SCULLY,"Damn it! Krycek, Mulder had him.",6
SKINNER,"Listen to me, anger is a luxury that you cannot afford right now. If you're angry you're gonna make a mistake, and these people will take advantage of that, you've seen how they operate",34
SCULLY,I'll be ok,3
SKINNER,Scully.. if you can't keep your head.. it's all right to step away.,13
SCULLY,It's exactly what they want,5
SCULLY,": Addendum to case number 621517, in the absence of any official response my request to have my sister's case reopened, I am now petitioning to devote full Bureau resources to the search for Alex Krycek. Since agent Mulder's release from the hospital, we have had no success locating Krycek or the 2 men he described as his abductors. Personally, I believe Krycek is the key to identify the larger forces behind the crime we are investigating. He alone can name the man who shot my sister, and explain the strange radiation deaths aboard the French salvage vessel.",97
MULDER,It looked great on me in the store.,8
SCULLY,What's this doing here?,4
MULDER,I had it flown it from San Diego as evidence.,10
SCULLY,Evidence of what?,3
MULDER,"The suit was covered in a thin film of oil, as was the French diver when I found him lying delirious on his kitchen floor.",25
SCULLY,What kind of oil?,4
MULDER,"Well from the reports I'm getting, it's the same substance that was found on the French diver's wife when she was discovered on the floor of a Hong Kong airport bathroom a few days ago. According to the analysis, it's 50-weight diesel oil. It's the same oil that was used during World War II submarines and on P-51 Mustangs for that matter.",62
SCULLY,I don't understand.,3
MULDER,"This oil is not only 50 years old Scully, but its composition has been altered by exposure to radiation.",19
SCULLY,I still don't understand how did this get onto the diver and then onto the diver's wife.,17
MULDER,"This just wasn't ordinary diesel oil, I think it's huh.. I think it's a medium, a medium being used by some kind of alien creature that uses it to .. body jump.",31
SCULLY,So you're saying that this stuff has intelligence.,8
MULDER,"I think that it came off of whatever they pulled from the bottom of the Pacific ocean, it's been waiting 50 years down there for another host, another body to bring it up to the surface.",36
SCULLY,Waiting to jump into the diver and then into the diver's wife.,12
MULDER,And then into Krycek.,4
SCULLY,Krycek?,1
MULDER,"I think that Mrs Gauthier went to Hong Kong under the control of this thing to find Krycek. I know, I know how it sounds.",25
SCULLY,Is anybody not looking for Krycek?,6
MULDER,"No but I think that the 64 thousand dollar question is what is this thing looking for? And now that it's in Krycek, what does it want?",27
BYERS,You should call upon our service more often.,8
LANGLY,We show a talent for these G-man activities.,8
MULDER,You mean if I want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead pipe?,14
FROHIKE,Only if you want the job done right.,8
MULDER,It's gone.,2
KRYCEK,Where is it? expecting you. Put that down. I have what you want.,13
CSM,There was a weather delay on the shuttle from Washington.,10
WELL-MANICURED MAN,You had business there?,4
CSM,Yes. You huh.. may have already heard another location.,9
CSM,These new attempts to recover it have increased our need for security.,12
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Who else is looking for it? look for it.,9
CSM,I can assure you it will be completely inaccessible now.,10
CSM,Leaks in security and a heightened public interest have made the base of Nevada unviable. Is this why I was called here?,22
WELL MANICURED MAN,"No, we'd like an explanation about this business with the assistant director of the Bureau, Skinner.",16
CSM,Random shooting for all I know.,6
WELL MANICURED MAN,"They have a waitress, who has given a description of the shooter, they released a composite of his face to the press. One of yours, isn't he?",27
CSM,"I don't know what to tell you. If he did, he acted on his own.",15
WELL MANICURED MAN,Good lord.,2
CSM,I'll take care of it.,5
WELL MANICURED MAN,"My advice to you sir, is to understand the priority here, get the shooter out of the country as quickly as possible, if the assistant director IDs him, our well placed operatives won't be able to stand in the way of an arrest, compromising beyond repair the secrecy of our work, and the security as you so arrogantly assert of our project's future.",63
CSM,It'll be handled.,3
MULDER,Let me see that.,4
BYERS,Your guys at the FBI turned a major serial murderer with a vestigial pen impression.,15
MULDER,Hand me a pencil.,4
LANGLY,Your sci-crime guys at the Bureau have a laser there that can measure any change in a surface down to a few nanometers,23
BYERS,"Actually they can lift perfect impression using magnetic toner and a sheet of mylar an electrostatic device is applied to the specimen, and renders the information, by drawing the toner from the indentation to the mylar surface.",37
FROHIKE,Actually..,1
MULDER,"Actually, it's a phone number, New York City area code , 555 1012. Now don't drop that that's a finely calibrated piece of investigative equipment. I gotta make a phone call.",30
FROHIKE,I'll be damned.,3
MAN,"Yes? No this is a private line, you must have misdialed. No there's no one here to take your call. I'm sorry I can't help you. Please hold on.",29
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Who is this?,3
MULDER,Who is this?,3
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Who gave you this number?,5
MULDER,You probably know. A man named Krycek.,7
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Alex Krycek?,2
MULDER,"Yeah nice guy, killed my father, you wouldn't happen to know where he is, do you?",16
WELL-MANICURED MAN,It's Mr Mulder isn't it?,5
MULDER,It's so nice of you to remember.,7
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Mr Mulder, can we meet somewhere?",6
MULDER,I would love to.,4
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Give your phone number to my assistant, he will call you back in 5 minutes. Tell him I'll meet him in 3 hours in Central Park, near the lighted walkway off 79th, near the reservoir. When you hang up, have this number disconnected.",43
FULLER,Well we got a name to go with the face.,10
SCULLY,Beautiful.,1
FULLER,"His name is Luis Cardinal , native of Nicaragua, school of the America's alumni, career mercenary, apparently impressed a lot of people with his marksmanship during the Iran contra deal.",29
SCULLY,I'll bet.,2
FULLER,That's actually the good news.,5
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
CALECA,"He entered the country without a visa or papers. As far as we can tell we can't find anything on him, address, phone number, financials, nothing.",26
SCULLY,Does he have an alias?,5
CALECA,"Several, non-checked out either in all likelihood, this guy's already out of the country.",14
SCULLY,"Damn it, they think they can just get away with it.",11
FULLER,I wish I could tell you otherwise.,7
SCULLY,Keep looking for him.,4
FULLER,We.. pretty much exhausted our avenues.,6
SCULLY,What's it gonna take?,4
CALECA,At this point? Other than a sign from God?,9
SCULLY,"I've seen stranger things, believe me.",6
MAN,I believe she has.,4
WELL MANICURED MAN,I trust we're all alone.,5
MULDER,"We're all alone in New York City, sir.",8
WELL MANICURED MAN,"You're looking for Alex Krycek, to kill him, in revenge. What makes you think we haven't done that already?",19
MULDER,What for?,2
WELL MANICURED MAN,Tell me what you know and I'll consider giving you Krycek.,11
MULDER,"No, you'll answer a few questions for me first, like what was pulled off the bottom of the Pacific ocean.",20
WELL MANICURED MAN,"It was a UFO, a so called foo-fighter, downed by American fighter pilots in the 2nd World War.",18
MULDER,Left out until now?,4
WELL MANICURED MAN,"There was salvage attempts. A US sub was sent in 50 years ago, but there were complications.",17
MULDER,Almost the entire crew died.,5
WELL MANICURED MAN,"Yeah, it's still a mystery.",5
MULDER,A mystery to whom?,4
WELL MANICURED MAN,"The cover story said it was the 3rd A bomb bound to Japan, but the truth is, no one knows what killed that crew.",24
MULDER,I know.,2
WELL MANICURED MAN,Do you now?,3
MULDER,You give me Krycek and I will tell you.,9
WELL MANICURED MAN,"Mr Mulder, I've given you so much this evening, you offered me next to nothing in return.",17
MULDER,You haven't told me anything I didn't already know.,9
WELL MANICURED MAN,"I'm curious, if you've encountered Krycek, why didn't you kill him then?",12
MULDER,'Cause he has the tape.,5
WELL MANICURED MAN,"Ahh yes, the tape .",4
MULDER,"The tape he's been selling those secrets off. You don't know where he is either, do you? You're looking for him too.",22
WELL MANICURED MAN,"Mr Mulder, everyone can be gotten to, certainly, you've no doubt of that. Mr Mulder?",15
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"Scully it's me. The 2 guards you had posted in front of Skinner's room, are they still there?",18
SCULLY,They should be why?,4
MULDER,"I want you to get down there and double check for me, ok?",13
SCULLY,I got it covered Mulder.,5
MULDER,"Just get down there and check, ok?",7
SCULLY,"Nurse, what happened to the guards who were outside this room?",11
NURSE,They've left.,2
SCULLY,Where did they go? And what happened to the man who was in this room?,15
NURSE,Mr Skinner is no longer a patient here.,8
SCULLY,Where is he?,3
NURSE,"Well the oderlies were here a few moments ago, and they took him away.",14
SCULLY,Where did they take him?,5
NURSE,"To another hospital, the ambulance must have just left.",9
SCULLY,Thank you. Walter Skinner?,4
DRIVER,"yeah, is there something wrong?",5
SCULLY,"No everything is fine, I'm just gonna ride with you the rest of the way, ok?",16
SKINNER,"Agent Scully, what are you doing here?",7
SCULLY,I just wanted to make sure you got where you were going safely.,13
SKINNER,What is this Scully?,4
SCULLY,You just lie still,4
SCULLY,Federal agent stop right there! Are you Luis Cardinal?! Are you Luis Cardinal?!,13
CARDINAL,Please.,1
CARDINAL,"Don't kill me, please.",4
SCULLY,You shot my sister!,4
CARDINAL,Please I can tell you.,5
SCULLY,Tell me!,2
CARDINAL,I can tell you.,4
SCULLY,Tell me!,2
CARDINAL,"I can tell you what you want, you want Krycek, I can tell you where he is? Please, please don't shoot me.",22
OFFICER,Don't move.,2
MULDER,Yeah Mulder.,2
SCULLY,"Mulder it's me, where are you?",6
MULDER,At the airport in New York.,6
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
MULDER,I'm looking for my rental car agreement.,7
SCULLY,What are you doing in New York?,7
MULDER,I'll tell you when I see you.,7
SCULLY,"Mulder, your instincts were right about Skinner. We've just arrested a man for what looks like attempted murder.",18
MULDER,Who?,1
SCULLY,"It's him Mulder, the man who shot my sister.",9
MULDER,Scully..,1
SCULLY,"Mulder listen to me, he said he knows where Krycek is. I don't know if this makes any sense to you, he says he's headed towards an abandoned missile site somewhere in North Dakota.",34
MULDER,"I want you to meet me at the DC airport in an hour, I want you to get 2 tickets on the 1st flight for North Dakota.",27
SCULLY,What's in North Dakota?,4
MULDER,The salvaged UFO.,3
SCULLY,There must be 200 silos out here. If I'm correct they were all filled with concrete in accord with the disarmament treaty when the base was decommissioned.,27
MULDER,I didn't sign any disarmament treaty.,6
SCULLY,My ears are still popping.,5
MULDER,We're 8 stories down.,4
SCULLY,Where's the concrete?,3
MULDER,"Apparently, nobody else signed that treaty either.",7
SCULLY,"1 down, 199 silos to go.",6
MULDER,These tunnels must go on for miles.,7
MULDER,He's here.,2
MAN,Hold it right there!,4
MAN,Hold!,1
MAN,Hands in the air! Come on! Come on!,8
MULDER,"He's here. You led him here, didn't you?",8
CSM,There's nothing here but holes in the ground Mr Mulder.,10
MULDER,Why are you here? Why all these men?,8
CSM,"I don't know, you owe me answers.",7
MULDER,"The UFO's here. That's what Krycek's after, isn't it?",9
CSM,Krycek? Alex Krycek disappeared 5 months ago.,7
SCULLY,We saw bodies in there. Men with radiation burns!,9
CSM,You saw nothing .,3
MULDER,You won't get away with this! You can't bury the truth!,11
CSM,Take these away.,3
MULDER,"Yeah. Sir, I didn't expect you back to work for a few weeks.",13
SKINNER,"I was looking for agent Scully, there was something I wanted to talk to her about, thank you.",18
MULDER,"Actually I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to thank you for everything you did.",16
SKINNER,You mean getting a shot in the gut?,8
MULDER,You got a shot because you stood up to these people.,11
SKINNER,"I think you're perceiving from a mistaken impression, what I did, I did it because it's my job.",18
MULDER,"From what I understand, you put your job and your life on the line for Scully.",16
SKINNER,"This isn't my crusade agent Mulder. A woman was murdered, I mistakenly thought that we could bring the man who committed that crime to justice.",25
MULDER,What do you mean mistakenly?,5
SKINNER,This is what I need to talk to Scully about. 1962-1995),11
SCULLY,"I was just thinking about something that a man said to me. That the.. that the dead speak to us from beyond the grave, that that what's conscience is.",29
MULDER,"It's interesting, I never thought of it that way.",9
SCULLY,"You know I thought... when we found him, this man that killed Melissa, that..that when we brought him to justice, I would feel some kind of closure. But the truth is no court.. no punishment is ever enough.",38
MULDER,"I came here to tell you something there may be some justice, just not the kind you're looking for.",19
SCULLY,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,"They found this man, Luis Cardinal, dead in his cell.",10
SCULLY,How?,1
MULDER,They made it look like a suicide. The men he worked for couldn't take the chance that he point his finger at them.,23
SCULLY,And what about Krycek?,4
MULDER,Oh he was there. I know that.,7
SCULLY,You think they got to him too.,7
MULDER,"I don't know, but if they haven't they will. I doubt it'll weight on their consciences though.",17
SCULLY,"I think the dead are speaking to us Mulder, demanding justice. Maybe that man was right. Maybe we bury the dead alive.",22
KRYCEK'S VOICE,Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help me! Help me!,9
