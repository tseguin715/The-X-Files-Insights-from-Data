MORRIS,Once upon a time there were three... how shall I put this... geeks. Three more unlikely heroes there never were.,20
BYERS,We defend the defenceless. I don't see any other way.,10
MORRIS,It wasn't long before their naivete nearly got them killed. So they hooked up with an FBI agent.,18
BYERS,"That's why we like you, Mulder. Your ideas are weirder than ours.",12
MORRIS,"And began publishing a... what shall I call it... rag, called ""The Lone Gunman.""",14

BRITTANY,"Morris? Morris, it's going ""ping!""",5
MORRIS,"Oh, it most certainly is.",5
MORRIS,Ping.,1
BRITTANY,"You're gonna make me spill. Morris, what is all that stuff, anyway?",12
MORRIS,"Now baby, don't make me talk shop. It is so boring.",11
BRITTANY,But I want to know.,5
MORRIS,"All right. where do I begin? You know we're in the Bermuda Triangle, right?",14
BRITTANY,Mmmm-hmmm...,1
MORRIS,That place where all those planes and ships mysteriously disappeared.,10
BRITTANY,Mmmm-hmmm...,1
MORRIS,"Who do you think named it the ""Bermuda Triangle""?",9
BRITTANY,Wait. You?,2
MORRIS,"Yeah, that was in my former life, before I joined the private sector. There are a lot of things I can't talk about, owing to matters of National Security. But I will say this... there are powerful forces out here. Primal, other worldly forces. Hidden beneath the waves. Just waiting to be... plucked by man.",55
BRITTANY,Somebody's coming.,2
MORRIS,"Hey, whatever you're sellin', we don't want any, okay? No ghanga.",11
MORRIS,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!",6
MORRIS,"Uh... Oh, you want the girl? I... I can dig it. I'm down with that.",15
MORRIS,"Uh... Oh, wait, wait, wait, guys! This is a rental! There's a 15 thousand dollar deposit on this",18
MAN,Your employer wanted me to tell you... You're fired.,9
DOGGETT,Morris Fletcher?,2
MORRIS,Finally. What took you so long? You must be Reyes. Enchanté.,11
REYES,"Yeah. Mr. Fletcher, we've been told you requested us by name. We're very curious about that.",16
MORRIS,"Well, you two head the FBI's X-Files unit, do you not? I thought you'd appreciate what I have to offer.",20
DOGGETT,Which is?,2
MORRIS,"You have no idea who you're sittin' here with, do you?",11
DOGGETT,A guy who's up fudge creek for violatin' the Federal Secrets Act. How's that for starters?,16
MORRIS,"I-I've got Top Security Clearance. I'm supposed to check-in every month with my former employer. So I skipped a few phone calls. Big deal. Let me give you a hint. I used to work at Groom Lake, Nevada. Area 51? I was a man in black. ""The"" Men in Black. What you've never heard of us?",56
DOGGETT,I saw the movie.,4
MORRIS,"Yeah, well... there were a lot of technical inaccuracies in that thing. Anyway, I'm ready to make a deal.",19
DOGGETT,What deal would that be?,5
MORRIS,The one that saves my furry pink ass. People are tryin' to kill me. Did you hear about my boat?,20
REYES,Yeah. Your female companion told us what she witnessed.,9
MORRIS,"My fem... Oh, you mean they didn't kill...",8
REYES,Brittany? Brittney?,2
MORRIS,"Brittany. Oh... Oh, thank God she's still alive. Look, I need protection. I need to get out of here. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. I can give you guys the keys to the kingdom. UFO's, aliens, the whole 50 year cover-up. I was there for all of it.",50
REYES,"Tell me, Mr. Fletcher, these documents of yours? Are they indicative of the kind of secrets you can reveal to us?",21
MORRIS,Honey... they're just the tip of the iceberg.,8
REYES,"This is the Jupiter Two from ""Lost In Space.""",9
MORRIS,"Okay, yeah. Yeah, those-those-those are B.S. But only those. Yeah, I was freelancing for this foreign billionaire. I told him the Air Force lost a flying saucer in the Bermuda Triangle, and that I could recover it for him. I just wanted to cruise the Bahamas. I never would have given him the real thing. That would be un-American.",59
DOGGETT,Come now.,2
MORRIS,"Look, he found out about it. Now he wants to kill me. I need protection. Super Soldiers.",17
DOGGETT,What do you know about Super Soldiers?,7
MORRIS,A bit. It may be there's one I can help you lay your hands on.,15
DOGGETT,This Super Solider... he have a name?,7
MORRIS,"Not ""he"".... ""She"".",3
FROHIKE,What the hell do they want?,6
DOGGETT,Gentlemen.,1
REYES,What happened here? Did you get robbed?,7
LANGLY,No...,1
FROHIKE,"Uh, we're upgrading everything.",4
LANGLY,Yeah. We gave away all our old crap to the Salvation Army. We're buying totally new stuff.,17
BYERS,"Well, what can we do for you, agents?",8
DOGGETT,"Well, we were hoping you could help us out. You know that for months now, we've been investigating this secret cadre. These, uh, so-called Super Soldiers.",26
BYERS,Genetically altered humans.,3
FROHIKE,You mean the ones that want to kill Mulder.,9
REYES,Exactly. We'd like your help tracking one down.,8
DOGGETT,This woman.,2
REYES,Do you recognize her?,4
LANGLY,"She's, uh... she's a fellow hacker. Damn fine one.",9
BYERS,"She calls herself Yves Adele Harlow. Uh, it's not her real name.",12
FROHIKE,"Well, we never learned her real name. She disappeared a year ago and nobody's seen her since.",17
DOGGETT,"No, we have reason to believe that she's resurfaced, and that she's become one of these Super Soldiers.",18
FROHIKE,What in the hell are you talking about? She's no Super Soldier.,12
BYERS,Absolutely not.,2
LANGLY,Not a chance. Who told you that?,7
MORRIS,This is pointless. These three monkeys couldn't find stink in an outhouse. Why are we even here?,17
FROHIKE,You... son of a...,4
FROHIKE,Let me at him! I'll kill him!,7
LANGLY,I'll hold him down!,4
REYES,"Whoa, fellas.",2
BYERS,You got a nerve coming here.,6
FROHIKE,You little son of a bitch!,6
MORRIS,Told you they wouldn't help.,5
DOGGETT,"All right, everybody just shut up.",6
BYERS,This man is a professional liar. every word out of his mouth.,12
LANGLY,He's a scam artist. He used us to track Yves down a year ago.,14
FROHIKE,And then he abducted her.,5
MORRIS,"Which is why I know what happened to her. I facilitated a meeting, is all. The man I was working for, I didn't know in advance what he was planning to do to her. Not my finest hour. I'll admit it.",41
BYERS,every word out of his mouth.,6
MORRIS,"Agents, I'm tellin' ya, you don't want these three involved. I mean, they don't even have their ridiculous tinker toy gizmos. This place is like ""How The Grinch Stole Radio Shack.""",31
DOGGETT,"All right, you three know this woman, I want your help. We need to track down this Yves Adele Harlow.",20
PROFESSOR HOUGHTON,"Knock, please.",2
PROFESSOR HOUGHTON,"Oh. My office hours are three to five, Mondays and Fridays.",11
YVES,"You'll make time for me, Professor.",6
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,"Douglas, are you ready to go? Douglas?",7
LANGLY,Airline reservation database. What name do we look under?,9
BYERS,Try her old stand-by. Different anagrams of Lee Harvey Oswald.,10
MORRIS,"""Area 51 Exposé!"" Ooo! Where's your new issue? This one's a year old.",13
FROHIKE,"Back off, Skeezick.",3
MORRIS,You'll never find her that way.,6
LANGLY,He's right. No anagrams for Yves Adele Harlow.,8
MORRIS,"So, who's Joey?",3
LANGLY,What? Joey Ramone? Leader of the greatest punk rock band in human history. Now shut up!,16
LANGLY,What?,1
MORRIS,"What are you, 34, 35? Why don't you cut your hair and grow up, huh?",15
LANGLY,"I need to remind you, Fletcher, that Doggett and Reyes aren't here to save you.",15
MORRIS,"Get yourself a real hero, anyway. Not some dead teeny bopper.",11
LANGLY,"You want to know why Joey Ramone's my hero? 'Cause people like you never managed to grind him down. They never stole his spirit. He never gave in, never gave up, and never sold out. Right till his last breath. And he's not dead. Guys like that? They live forever.",50
BYERS,Langly? Just ignore him.,4
MORRIS,"Look, if we have to work together, let's work together.",10
FROHIKE,We don't have to work together.,6
MORRIS,"Watching you three try and find your butts with both hands is not my idea of a fun time. Now, wouldn't it be easier tracking Yves if you knew her real name?",32
BYERS,You know her real name?,5
MORRIS,Lois Runtz.,2
BYERS,Lois Runtz. Uh-huh.,3
MORRIS,"I'm telling you the truth, boys.",6
FROHIKE,"Well, if you were, it'd be a first.",8
BYERS,Nobody knows about that door. That's our secret door.,9
MORRIS,Does Lois know about it? Yves?,6
BYERS,Jimmy?,1
JIMMY,Guys...,1
LANGLY,"Jimmy? How you feelin', man?",5
MORRIS,"Oh, right. The old errand boy. The guy used to intern for you losers, right? I wondered what happened to you.",21
JIMMY,Why is he here?,4
BYERS,FBI business. It's a long story.,6
FROHIKE,"Where the hell ya been, big guy?",7
JIMMY,"Zurich. I was in Malta. And Yemen. And just now, New Jersey. It's been a rough geology lesson. I ran out of money, so I hitch-hiked here. I snuck in the back, 'cause I didn't know if the place was being watched. I just had to see you guys. It's about Lois. Lois Runtz - that's Yves' real name.",58
MORRIS,"I told ya so. Hey, wait a minute. You tracked her all over the world? You? Mr. Brain Power here is lucky to be alive. Why did you send him? Were you tryin' to get him killed?",37
LANGLY,He sent himself to find Yves. We tried to talk him out of it.,14
JIMMY,Now I almost wish you had.,6
BYERS,"Jimmy, what is it? Are you all right?",8
JIMMY,"Last night... I traced her to a little college in New Jersey. It's the closest I've been... been in a year of searching. I saw her. I actually laid my eyes on her. I called to her. But she ran. Later on, I... I found out. Guys? I think she murdered somebody.",52
YVES,One down.,2
REYES,"John Gillnitz? I'm Agent Reyes, and this is Agent Doggett. Is this the woman you saw last night?",18
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,"Uh... it was dark, uh... it could have been her. Do you have her in custody?",16
DOGGETT,"We're workin' on it. Sir, what can you tell us about your friend? Do you have any reason why he may have been targeted?",24
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,"Absolutely none. Douglas was a wonderful teacher, and an even better researcher.",12
REYES,What did he research?,4
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,"Elasmo Bronchi. Sharks, rays and skates.",6
REYES,He was a marine biologist?,5
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,An immunologist. Sharks have a remarkable immune system. Toxins that would kill nearly any other vertebrate pass right through them.,20
DOGGETT,So he did medical research?,5
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,Douglas wanted to save the world.,6
MORRIS,"Cheer up, Gomer. You're bringin' the whole room down.",9
KIMMY,"This is a computer, Langly. Com-pu-ter. Step away before you embarrass yourself.",12
LANGLY,"Always a pleasure, Kimmy.",4
KIMMY,"Yeah, yeah! So then, how do you wish to partake... of my hacking genius?",14
FROHIKE,"Well, thanks to Jimmy, we know Yves' real name.",9
MORRIS,"Hey, I told ya before he did.",7
LANGLY,Jimmy also told us what kind of car she's driving. Silver X5 with New York plates.,16
KIMMY,"Really? Way to go, Special Ed.",6
BYERS,The New Jersey Turnpike has video cameras at every toll booth. Langly hacked the system and spotted her southbound at Newark.,21
KIMMY,Somewhat creative.,2
LANGLY,We spotted her again going through the Fort McHenry Tunnel. She passed through not 20 minutes ago.,17
BYERS,"We're betting she's headed for D.C. We're going to try to intercept her, with your help..""",16
FROHIKE,Think you might find a military satellite you could piggy back? Give us a bird's-eye view of the beltway?,19
KIMMY,"Intriguing. Stand aside, ladies.",4
FROHIKE,We'll be on the cell.,5
MORRIS,I got shotgun.,3
LANGLY,Dream on. You're staying here.,5
BYERS,We need somebody we can trust keeping an eye on Fletcher.,11
JIMMY,I'm on it.,3
MORRIS,"So, how'd you like Malta?",5
MEDICAL EXAMINER,The only thing I can't say for sure is what killed him. He was injected with some sort of tiny poisoned pellet. But the wound in his chest? Was post-mortem.,30
DOGGETT,What is that?,3
MEDICAL EXAMINER,"That's what I said. My best guess is bioluminescence, but, uh, I'm still waitin' to hear back from our lab.",20
REYES,Bioluminescence? As in the stuff that makes lightning bugs glow?,10
MEDICAL EXAMINER,"Lightning bugs, plankton, jellyfish. But, uh, generally not dead college professors.",11
DOGGETT,"So what, this stuff was put on post-mortem?",8
MEDICAL EXAMINER,"No. As near as I can tell, it bleed out of him. it gets weirder still. When I opened him up, I found adhesions that indicate past surgery, so I'm figuring I'll find he had a bypass or a pacemaker. Instead, I find... this.",44
REYES,Looks like cartilage.,3
MEDICAL EXAMINER,It is. It was living tissue grafted into him. I have absolutely no idea why.,15
DOGGETT,"Look, it held something. Something that's now missing. Could that be the purpose of this wound? A little ad hoc surgery?",21
REYES,"Maybe that was the very purpose of the murder. Whatever was inside him, she removed it.",16
DOGGETT,What the hell was inside him?,6
MORRIS,"I have no clue. Seriously, this is the first time hearing of it. Weird organs? I don't know what to tell you.",22
REYES,You've never heard of the man? Professor Douglas Houghton?,9
MORRIS,You're looking at me oddly.,5
DOGGETT,Perhaps because you've been known to lie on occasion.,9
MORRIS,"Well I'm not lying now. I've said from the start, I didn't know what she was up to.",18
KIMMY,Dammit! Crashed again! I cannot make magic with sub-standard equipment.,10
DOGGETT,What's the problem?,3
KIMMY,"The problem is... it's a freakin' piece of junk! I knew those guys were broke, but this is pathetic.",19
REYES,The guys are broke?,4
KIMMY,Are you kidding? Look around this dump. They had to hock all their stuff just to pay the rent.,19
MORRIS,What about this?,3
KIMMY,"Oh, their ""paper""? Deader than disco. They haven't published in months.",11
MORRIS,"So saving the world doesn't pay the bills. There's a hot news flash for ya, huh? What chumps.",18
JIMMY,"They were gettin' by all right, till you put 'em out of business.",13
MORRIS,Oh. And how exactly did I do that?,8
JIMMY,"When you took Yves. They spent every last dime trying to find her. They're loyal to their friends. Hilarious, huh?",20
REYES,Reyes.,1
BYERS,You'd better get here quick.,5
REYES,Where are you?,3
BYERS,The Hotel Farragut. Hurry.,4
FROHIKE,She's gonna kill that guy.,5
BYERS,Doggett and Reyes are on their way.,7
LANGLY,By then it'll be too late.,6
FROHIKE,Yves! Don't do it!,4
JIMMY,Lois? Should I call you that?,6
YVES,I prefer Yves.,3
LANGLY,So... we take it you're not a Super Soldier?,9
YVES,Super what?,2
BYERS,Long story. Never mind.,4
FROHIKE,"You weren't seriously gonna smoke that guy, were you?",9
YVES,I know you three mean well. But I can't begin to tell you how badly you've mucked things up.,19
DOGGETT,"So, this guy just up and bolted?",7
LANGLY,"He hit her, and then he took off.",8
REYES,"Nobody's seen him. The room is registered to one Leonard Southhall of Darrian, Connecticut.",14
YVES,It's an alias.,3
DOGGETT,It's a stolen ID. The real Leonard Southhall died in 1996. You want to tell me who that was?,19
YVES,His real name? I have no idea.,7
DOGGETT,"This is your bag, isn't it? That was quite a party you got planned for him. Respirator. Surgical gloves. Scalpel. Not to mention this little item here.",27
REYES,"You were planning to cut him open, Ms. Runtz, just like you did the professor. Why?",16
JIMMY,It can't be true. Tell 'em it's not.,8
YVES,"It is, Jimmy. Time is running short. Unless you let me finish what I started, innocent people will die.",19
DOGGETT,You want to elaborate on that?,6
YVES,First things first. Who was it that put you on to me?,12
MORRIS,"Okay, guys. So she's not a Super Soldier. I made an honest mistake.",13
YVES,"As I suspected. It's a tracking device. I'm sure he meant to activate it, once he knew you had me.",20
DOGGETT,You've been wearin' that since Miami. You were runnin' a scam on us from the start.,16
REYES,"Blowing up the boat, the girl as your witness. You planned all that.",13
DOGGETT,That and all the Super Soldier bull. All that was just to hook us.,14
BYERS,"So that you two would, in turn, hook us.",9
FROHIKE,And we'd track down Yves for this slimeball all over again.,11
MORRIS,"Well, what can I tell you? You three always get the job done for me.",15
DOGGETT,"Who do you work for, Fletcher?",6
YVES,An international arms dealer. A billionaire. And scum of the earth.,11
MORRIS,And... he's also...,3
YVES,"My father. My father is a murderer, and a supporter of terrorism. I hate everything he stands for.",18
JIMMY,"Yves? You're a murderer, too.",5
YVES,"The man I killed was a terrorist, Jimmy. A zealot whose research was funded by my father for its potential as a weapons system.",24
REYES,"Houghton was an immunologist, doing research on sharks.",8
YVES,Yes. And he used his knowledge of their immune system to devise a vessel of sorts. One that kept him safe from an engineered virus that he carried within him.,30
DOGGETT,This man had living tissue implanted in his chest.,9
REYES,Cartilage. Shark cartilage. It contained something which you removed.,9
DOGGETT,That was this virus you're talkin' about?,7
YVES,"I destroyed it, but it was only one of two.",10
LANGLY,"Oh, man. The bald dude at the hotel. The one that got away.",13
YVES,"Think of him as a human time bomb. He can pass by any sniff dog, any metal detector, and no one would ever suspect.",24
BYERS,What triggers this time bomb?,5
YVES,Programmed cellular death. Genetically altered to a high degree of precision. The way the vessel is decaying inside of him is virtually clock-like. It will lose integrity and rupture at eight o'clock... tonight.,33
KIMMY,Five hours from now?,4
YVES,"This virus, once it's airborne, its kill radius is five or six miles, depending on the winds. Potentially, it could kill thousands. Tens of thousands.",25
FROHIKE,"Fletcher, I knew you were a dirt bag, but still... how could you be a party to this?",18
YVES,"Fletcher's a con-man, not a killer. He didn't know about it.",11
DOGGETT,"Providing all this is true, how do we track this man down?",12
LANGLY,"Kimmy, zoom in more. Zoom in!",6
KIMMY,"Back off, kibitzer! I'm doin' it! This thing is slower than Stumpy, my one-legged Granny. Where did you get this dinosaur turd?",22
JIMMY,Stop bellyachin' and work.,4
MORRIS,"Those things'll kill ya, ya know?",6
FROHIKE,That's why I quit 20 years ago. You want one?,10
MORRIS,"So, you're too broke to publish, huh? Pencil neck told me. It's a shame. This little rag always was such a hoot. I'm gonna miss it. But, hey, the world spins on, right? Maybe saving it is a younger man's game. Or a woman's.",44
FROHIKE,"Maybe it is. You gotta admit, Byers. It hasn't exactly been our year. And to top it all off, we screwed the pooch pretty good today. Maybe we should pack it in.",32
BYERS,"And do what instead? We never gave up. We never will. In the end, if that's the best they can say about us,... it'll do.",25
LANGLY,I got him!,3
KIMMY,"Hey, it's my hack, Langly. I got him.",8
LANGLY,"We got him, all right? Our bad guy just rented a blue Corolla under his alias Leonard Southhall. We just picked him up on Kimmy's satellite.",26
LANGLY,Haulin' north like a bat out of hell.,8
KIMMY,"New Jersey Turnpike, 30 miles south of Newark.",8
YVES,I think I know where he's headed.,7
BYERS,Lone Gunman Newspaper Group. Byers speaking.,6
DOGGETT,Byers? John Doggett.,3
BYERS,Agent Doggett. Do you have him?,6
DOGGETT,"Oh yeah, we got him. Listen, how much do you trust this Yves Harlow, Lois Runtz, whatever name she's tellin' you?",21
BYERS,Completely. Why?,2
DOGGETT,"Because the doctors here have run every kind of imaging on this guy, Southhall, and come up snake eyes. No virus, no cartilage vessel in his chest, nothin'.",28
BYERS,They found nothing.,3
YVES,That doesn't make sense.,4
BYERS,They're absolutely certain?,3
DOGGETT,One hundred percent. Agent Reyes and I are lookin' like a couple of fools on this one.,17
BYERS,There must be something we missed.,6
DOGGETT,"All I can tell you is, we got the wrong guy.",11
YVES,There must be a second man. I know there is. It's Basic Terrorism 101.,14
LANGLY,"Except we don't know his name, and we don't know his target.",12
JIMMY,And we've got one hour to find him.,8
EVENING SESSION 7,00 PM,2
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,Good Evening.,2
SECURITY GUARD,You're good.,2
YVES,"All my information pointed to that man, Leonard Southhall. He goes by an alias, he traveled to Washington on this very day.",22
BYERS,"Clearly, he's involved somehow.",4
JIMMY,He must be. He made a beeline right back to that biology department where the dead Professor worked.,18
FROHIKE,Their base of operation.,4
LANGLY,"Yeah. So if Southhall is involved, and yet he doesn't have the virus inside of him...?",16
YVES,So how exactly does he fit into their plan?,9
MORRIS,Three card Monty. You ever played it? You have now.,10
FROHIKE,What's that supposed to mean?,5
MORRIS,"It means these guys have you running after the Ace, when you should be chasing the Queen.",17
YVES,"Oh, my God. Southhall is the decoy. That's all he is.",11
MORRIS,"They knew that you were hot on their trail, so they gave you someone else to follow.",17
JIMMY,I thought you said you didn't know anything about terrorists?,10
MORRIS,"I don't. But boy, do I know scams. I wasn't a Man in Black all those years for nothing. They made you work at finding Southhall. Which tells me the real guy is hiding in plain sight. Right out in the open.",42
FROHIKE,"A friend of the dead Professor. A co-worker maybe..""",9
YVES,The man who saw me through the Professor's window. The one who identified me.,14
SPEAKER,"Ladies and gentlemen, scientists, academic leaders and government representatives, coming together is our goal this Evening. Coming together as one. Those words are easily spoken, but guiding our missile into that fugitive and vulnerable target, is hard.",37
SECURITY GUARD,Sorry. Conference attendees only.,4
BYERS,We're reporters.,2
SECURITY GUARD,What newspaper do you work for?,6
BYERS,Uh... uh... The Lone Gunman.,5
SECURITY GUARD,Never heard of it.,4
LANGLY,"We're legit, man.",3
FROHIKE,Come on. Come on. Passes. Show 'em your Press Pass.,10
YVES,"Sir, it's desperately important that we get in there.",9
JIMMY,"Yeah, buddy, come on.",4
SECURITY GUARD,These expired last December.,4
YVES,We've got five minutes.,4
BYERS,Listen to me. We believe there's a dangerous man in that room.,12
SECURITY GUARD,"Folks, I need all of you to step away, right now.",11
LANGLY,"Look, thousands of people may die.",6
SECURITY GUARD,Mike? I got a situation over by the main conference room.,11
JIMMY,"John Gillnitz! John Gillnitz!.""",4
SECURITY GUARD,"Step back, sir.",3
JIMMY,I'm really sorry.,3
JIMMY,Where'd he go?,3
YVES,Split up. Four minutes left. Good luck.,7
FROHIKE,"Hey, wait! What'll we do with this guy once we find him?",12
YVES,Hold him till I get there. I'll do the rest.,10
LANGLY,You mean cut him open?,5
YVES,"If that virus gets into the air stream, we'll have failed. People will die. Whatever it takes...",17
BYERS,Three minutes and counting.,4
BYERS,Don't try to run.,4
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,I don't have to.,4
LANGLY,"Yves, Jimmy, we found him!",5
FROHIKE,Over here!,2
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,"What do you plan to do? By my watch, it's two minuets to eight. Not much time for surgery.",19
BYERS,Yves! Jimmy!,2
PROFESSOR GILLNITZ,Now you have a minute forty.,6
FROHIKE,Guys?,1
BYERS,Whatever it takes.,3
JIMMY,Byers! Frohike! Langly!,3
JIMMY,"Yves, come here!",3
JIMMY,Guys!! Guys!!,2
JIMMY,"Oh god, no!!",3
BYERS,"Don't, Jimmy!",2
YVES,Don't. It's too late. They're already exposed.,7
JIMMY,"No, guys.",2
FROHIKE,Why do you fight the good fight?,7
LANGLY,Both of you.,3
BYERS,Never give up.,3
KIMMY,"in Spanish) Vayo con dios, amigos.",6
DOGGETT,Arlington. You must have pulled some big strings to get those guys in here.,14
SKINNER,It's the least I could do.,6
REYES,Are you ready?,3
DOGGETT,Yeah.,1
SKINNER,Dana?,1
SCULLY,I'll catch up. They meant so much to me. I'm not sure if they ever really knew.,17
JIMMY,Nobody knew... what heroes they were.,6
YVES,It's not right. It's not.,5
MORRIS,"No, it's not. Langly said to me, ""The ones who never give up, they never die.""",16
MORRIS,I still don't know what that means.,7
SCULLY,"It means that, like everyone buried here, the world is a better place for them having been in it. It means that they're gone... but they live on through us all.",31
