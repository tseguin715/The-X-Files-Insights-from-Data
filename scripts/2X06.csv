SCULLY ON MACHINE,"Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it. I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up. What the hell is this thing, Mulder? It's almost as if... it's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him. Mulder! I need your help!",72
DUANE BARRY ON MACHINE,Shut up!,2
SCULLY ON MACHINE,Mulder!,1
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
DUANE BARRY,"Come on, lady...",3
SCULLY,I need your help! Mulder!,5
POLICEMAN,"I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't disturb a crime scene.",10
MARGARET SCULLY,"But this is my daughter's apartment. Let me go, I have to get through. I have to get in!",19
MULDER,Mrs. Scully? She's not in there.,6
MARGARET SCULLY,Where is she? Where is she?,6
MARGARET SCULLY,"I knew it would happen this way. I had this dream about Dana being taken away. I, uh... I was going to call her but I was afraid I was going to scare her. She would have laughed at me anyway. She doesn't believe in that kind of thing, you know.",51
"FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 8",03 A.M.,2
SKINNER,"According to the reports I reviewed, Agent Scully research states that Duane Barry's propensity for violent, deviant behavior is due to brain damage from a bullet wound in the head. Is this the operational opinion?",35
KRYCEK,"Yes, sir.",2
SKINNER,Is there another?,3
KRYCEK,"He's convinced he's going to be abducted by aliens. That by taking someone to the abduction site, he won't be abducted himself.",22
SKINNER,That he's following orders from alien voices in his head.,10
KRYCEK,Yes.,1
SKINNER,"Well, that's an interesting spin on the Nuremburg defense. Which explanation do you subscribe to, Agent Mulder?",17
MULDER,There's a question of how he could've gotten to her in the first place.,14
MAN,And you think these alien voices told her?,8
MULDER,"Agent Scully was carrying a small piece of metal that was removed from Duane Barry's abdomen, an implant he described as a tracking device.",24
MAN,Agent Scully thought that you had made a major miscalculation in Duane Barry's psychosis. Is that true?,17
MULDER,"Yes, but that still doesn't explain how he could have found her.",12
SKINNER,Where would he be taking her?,6
MULDER,I don't know. He talked about a mountain but he wasn't specific about the location.,15
SKINNER,"Well, however he got to her and whatever his motives, he took Agent Scully's car and weapon. I think we all understand the seriousness of this matter and should proceed ahead quickly with all possible resources. I need you to turn over your files to H.R.T...",46
MULDER,I'd like to brief them myself...,6
SKINNER,"Go home, Agent Mulder, you've been up all night. Get some sleep.",12
MULDER,"Sir, I know Duane Barry. I've been in his head, I know how he thinks...",15
SKINNER,"You're too close to this case. If we can use you, we will.",13
MULDER,Sir...,1
SKINNER,"That's an order, Agent Mulder. Make sure he gets home safely.",11
KRYCEK,Come on.,2
"ROUTE 229; RIXEYVILLE, VIRGINIA; 11",23 A.M.,2
PATROLMAN,Sir? Can you turn off your radio?,7
DUANE BARRY,"I would, officer, but I got to keep going.",9
APB WIRE CONDUCTOR,An F.B.I. APB has been issued for a suspect in the abduction of an F.B.I. agent...,16
PATROLMAN,"Sir, I asked if you mind turning that off.",9
DUANE BARRY,Okay. But could you just give me the ticket now so I can go? I got to be someplace.,19
PATROLMAN,Where?,1
DUANE BARRY,I'm not sure but... they'll tell me when I get there.,11
PATROLMAN,Sir... put your hands on the steering wheel where I can see them.,13
DUANE BARRY,"You don't understand. They're waiting for me, I, I can't be late.",12
PATROLMAN,Put your hands up and exit the vehicle.,8
DUANE BARRY,"No, I got to keep moving. Please? For your own sake? Don't stop Duane Barry.",15
PATROLMAN,"Sir, put your hands up.",5
FBI HEADQUARTERS; VIDEO PRODUCTION UNIT; 3,11 P.M.,2
MULDER,Right there.,2
VIDEO TECHNICIAN,Okay.,1
MULDER,Back it up a few frames. Can you magnify this area?,11
VIDEO TECHNICIAN,My God...,2
MULDER,She's still alive. Print this up.,6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; 4,08 P.M.,2
DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING,I just want to go back to the place.,9
MULDER ON RECORDING,What place?,2
DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING,Where it first started. Where they first came and got me.,11
MULDER ON RECORDING,Where is that?,3
DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING,"A mountain. We went, uh, up... and up. Ascending... ascending to the stars. Ascending... ascending to the stars.",18
KRYCEK,Coffee?,1
MULDER,Yeah. Thanks.,2
KRYCEK,Yeah. How'd you sleep?,4
MULDER,I didn't.,2
DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING,"You're not taking Duane Barry again. A mountain. We went, uh, up... and up. Ascending... ascending to the stars. Ascending to the stars.",23
KRYCEK,What is it?,3
MULDER,Where was that patrolman killed again?,6
KRYCEK,"Rixeyville, Virginia. Route 229.",4
MULDER,Doesn't Route 229 lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway?,9
KRYCEK,I don't know. What?,4
MULDER,Ascend to the stars. Skyland Mountain.,6
KRYCEK,You know where he's going?,5
MULDER,Get your car and meet me downstairs.,7
KRYCEK,Where are we going?,4
MULDER,Just get your car.,4
KRYCEK,What about Skinner?,3
MULDER,I'll deal with Skinner.,4
KRYCEK,"He thinks Scully's been taken up to Skyland Mountain. I'll hold him off until they locate her. Wait, here he comes. I'll be in touch.",25
MULDER,"Come on, let's go.",4
"ROUTE 211; WARRENTON, VIRGINIA; 5",43 P.M.,2
KRYCEK,Hey! You're dozing off. Maybe I should drive.,8
MULDER,I'm fine.,2
KRYCEK,"Well, you haven't slept yet. I have.",7
MULDER,"No, I said I'm fine.",5
KRYCEK,"You know, Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez, Three Mile Island... they were all linked to sleep deprivation. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that over 190,000 fatal car crashes every year are linked to sleepiness.",33
MULDER,Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics?,14
KRYCEK,I'm just trying to keep you awake.,7
MULDER,"Look, I know you think we should have told Skinner but if he sends in the whole cavalry, Duane Barry might go over the edge.",25
KRYCEK,You're right.,2
MULDER,"If we find him first, we'll notify the Bureau. All right?",11
KRYCEK,Yeah. You really think he tracked her down with that implant?,11
MULDER,"Well, that's the easiest explanation. It's also the most implausible.",10
KRYCEK,Is there another possibility?,4
MULDER,Somebody could have given him her address. I don't know who.,11
KRYCEK,You seen this guy?,4
TRAM OPERATOR,"Yeah, he was here.",4
KRYCEK,He's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent. Did you let him go up in the tram?,16
TRAM OPERATOR,"No way, it's shut down for the summer. I told him to take the back road up.",17
KRYCEK,How long ago?,3
TRAM OPERATOR,About forty-five minutes.,3
MULDER,Did he have a woman with him?,7
TRAM OPERATOR,No.,1
KRYCEK,How long does it take to drive to the top?,10
TRAM OPERATOR,Little over an hour.,4
MULDER,You gotta get me up there.,6
TRAM OPERATOR,"No, no way. We just got done refitting the cable. It hasn't been tested with passengers yet. You'll have to drive.",21
MULDER,I don't have the time.,5
TRAM OPERATOR,You don't have a choice.,5
MULDER,"No, you don't have a choice.",6
TRAM OPERATOR,"Okay, I can't stop you from going up there but if there's a problem with the cable, I'm shutting this down. I'm not going to be responsible for your death.",30
KRYCEK,What are you doing?,4
MULDER,"Stay here and whatever happens, don't let him stop the tram.",11
TRAM OPERATOR,"Okay, you hit your ""run"" and ""up"" button on the panel. Speed indicator controls your ascent. Now when you want to slow down... Don't crank it faster than fifteen! What the hell's he doing? I told him not to go that fast. Base to car one, pick up. Do you hear that sound? At this speed, the cable can't hold....a sec. Do you hear me? Slow...",66
MULDER,Go ahead.,2
TRAM OPERATOR,Slow it down.,3
MULDER,You're breaking up.,3
TRAM OPERATOR,Slow down or the cables'll jump when you hit that tower! Slow it down for the next tower.,18
KRYCEK,How close is he?,4
TRAM OPERATOR,Should be up top in a minute. There he is.,10
MULDER,"What are you doing? Turn it back on. Krycek, what's happening down there? Krycek, do you read me? Tell the operator to restart the tram. Hello?",26
KRYCEK,I've got him stalled up there. I'll hold until you advise.,11
MULDER,Is there an emergency system on-board? Can you read me down there? Can anyone read me?,16
MULDER,Federal agent!,2
DUANE BARRY,Yes!,1
MULDER,Freeze!,1
DUANE BARRY,"Yes, yes, yes!",3
MULDER,I said freeze! Where is she?,6
DUANE BARRY,"I'm free, you son of a bitches! You can't touch Duane Barry anymore!",13
MULDER,Don't move. Don't move!,4
DUANE BARRY,I'm not going anywhere!,4
MULDER,Where is she? Where'd you leave her?,7
DUANE BARRY,They took her.,3
MULDER,Who?,1
DUANE BARRY,"Them! I told you they would take somebody else. They did! No, no! No! No, no, no! No! No! No! No! Nooo! Noooo!",23
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN SUMMIT; 8,46 P.M.,2
APB WIRE CONTROLLER,Choppers found them on the mountain. Send out five teams to search for that federal agent.,16
MEDIC #2,Water.,1
MEDIC #1,We'll wait outside.,3
MULDER,Now what happened after you took her out of the trunk?,11
DUANE BARRY,We walked a-little ways up to the top of the mountain. Right where you found me.,16
MULDER,Then where'd you take her?,5
DUANE BARRY,I didn't. They did. That was the deal. Her instead of me.,12
MULDER,Did you kill her?,4
DUANE BARRY,No. I swear.,3
MULDER,How'd you get this?,4
DUANE BARRY,From the ship.,3
MULDER,What ship?,2
DUANE BARRY,You saw it.,3
MULDER,I saw a helicopter.,4
DUANE BARRY,They were here. I'm not lying to you! There they are. Ask them. They know what happened!,17
MULDER,"Sit down, Duane.",3
DUANE BARRY,"No! You've got to stop them! Hurry, hurry! They were just out there! They were right outside!",17
MULDER,"Duane, settle down!",3
DUANE BARRY,"They'll tell you where she is! The military's in on it, just ask them!",14
MULDER,Did you hurt her?,4
DUANE BARRY,No.,1
MULDER,Did you hurt her!?,4
DUANE BARRY,No!,1
MULDER,What is this?,3
DUANE BARRY,I'm sorry. They had to take her. I hope they're not hurting her... too much with the tests. I'm sorry.,20
KRYCEK,Hey?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
KRYCEK,"What, what's the matter, what, what'd he say to you?",10
MULDER,"No, he's giving me nothing. Were you out here alone?",10
KRYCEK,"Yeah, why?",2
MULDER,Nobody goes in or out of that room.,8
MAN,"Hey, Mulder?",2
APB WIRE CONTROLLER,"Rescue two, we're on the Warsaw building, southwest.",8
MULDER,What are you doing in there?,6
KRYCEK,I heard him...,3
MULDER,Come here.,2
KRYCEK,"I heard him gagging in there, he couldn't breathe.",9
MULDER,No one...,2
KRYCEK,I...,1
MULDER,No one!,2
KRYCEK,He said you choked him!,5
MULDER,No one is to interrogate the suspect.,7
KRYCEK,Except you.,2
MULDER,Except me. Did you ask him about Scully?,8
KRYCEK,Yeah.,1
MULDER,What'd he say?,3
KRYCEK,"He started whistling ""Stairway to Heaven."" Keep an eye on him.",11
GUARD,Okay.,1
SKINNER,You got Duane Barry?,4
MULDER,"Yes, sir.",2
SKINNER,"Agent Mulder, you disobeyed my direct order.",7
GUARD,Call the paramedics!,3
MULDER,What happened?,2
GUARD,He was gagging...,3
MULDER,Duane? Duane? Duane!,3

"FBI ACADEMY MORGUE; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA; 6","07 AM ""Medical Examiner Mulder is standing over it. A female doctor walks in.)",14
PATHOLOGIST,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy of this man's autopsy report.,12
PATHOLOGIST,"I'm sorry, it's still incomplete.",5
MULDER,Are you the pathologist?,4
PATHOLOGIST,Yes.,1
MULDER,Can I ask what your preliminary findings are?,8
PATHOLOGIST,"Umm... ""Second-degree burns to the face, contusions about the neck, bruised larynx..."" If I had to list cause of death at this point, I'd have to say asphyxiation. Were you expecting something else?",33
MULDER,You haven't run a toxicological yet?,6
PATHOLOGIST,They should be finished shortly.,5
MULDER,I'd be interested to see what you find. When will they be on file?,14
PATHOLOGIST,Later this morning.,3
MULDER,"I'd like a copy as soon as possible, please.",9
PATHOLOGIST,"Oh, I'm sorry, you'll have to go through regular military channels.",11
MULDER,"What do you mean, ""military?"" You're not F.B.I.?",8
PATHOLOGIST,Quantico's under military jurisdiction. There wasn't an F.B.I. pathologist available this morning.,12
"DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON, D.C.; 6",16 AM,2
KRYCEK,Skinner's expecting my report on the Duane Barry incident. What do I tell him?,14
CSM,The truth.,2
KRYCEK,What do you mean?,4
CSM,"Confirm Mulder's version of events. You've earned his trust, the object now is to preserve it.",16
KRYCEK,For how much longer?,4
CSM,Until your assignment is complete.,5
KRYCEK,"If Mulder is such a threat, why not eliminate him?",10
CSM,That's not policy.,3
KRYCEK,It's not? After what you had me do?,8
CSM,Kill Mulder and you risk turning one man's religion into a crusade.,12
KRYCEK,What about Scully?,3
CSM,We've taken care of that.,5
KRYCEK,How?,1
CSM,We tell you only what you need to know.,9
KRYCEK,I think I have a right to know.,8
CSM,"You have no rights, only orders to be carried out. If you have a problem with that, we'll make other arrangements.",21
"FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 10",36 A.M.,2
SKINNER,"Victim appears to have expired from prolonged hypoxemia, secondary to asphyxiation. Several possible etiologies and most likely strangulation due to the presence of contusions and a bruised larynx. Do you want to speak to this, Agent Mulder?",37
MULDER,"I didn't kill him, if that's what you're suggesting.",9
SKINNER,But you attacked him?,4
MULDER,I was interrogating him about Agent Scully. He wasn't cooperating so I pushed him.,14
MAN,And you lost control.,4
MULDER,"Momentarily. But then I left the room. He was very much alive, I spoke to him. Agent Krycek spoke to him.",21
SKINNER,Agent Krycek says he entered the room because the suspect was gagging.,12
MULDER,Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too?,9
SKINNER,"No. He corroborates your story. But the fact is, we've got a dead suspect, Agent Mulder and no other plausible cause of death. O.P.C. wants the both of you to take a lie detector test. You're to report there immediately.",40
MULDER,There is another plausible cause of death.,7
SKINNER,Which is?,2
MULDER,Poisoning by injection or ingestion.,5
SKINNER,Poisoning?,1
MULDER,You won't find that on the navy pathologist's report.,9
SKINNER,"What are you saying, Agent Mulder?",6
MULDER,That the autopsy is incomplete. That the military covered up the toxicological findings.,13
SKINNER,And why would they do that?,6
MULDER,Because they know where Scully is.,6
MAN,"Why are you so paranoid, Mulder?",6
MULDER,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because I find it hard to trust anybody.",14
MULDER,"Alex? Alex, can I borrow your car keys?",8
KRYCEK,"Why, where are you going?",5
MULDER,There's someone I've got to see.,6
KRYCEK,"Yeah, but we're scheduled at O.P.C...",6
MULDER,"I know, just give me the car keys please. Thanks.",10
OFFICE OF SENATOR RICHARD MATHESON; 11,45 A.M.,2
X,"You've wasted a trip, Mister Mulder. There's nothing the Senator can do for you now.",15
MULDER,What?,1
X,Not without committing political suicide.,5
MULDER,Why? Do they have something on him?,7
X,"They have something on everyone, Mister Mulder. The question is when they'll use it.",14
MULDER,I need his help.,4
X,No one can help you now. Your channels of appeal and recourse are closed.,14
MULDER,"Your predecessor could have helped me. Oh... you know, don't you? You know what's happened to her.",17
X,"This reaches beyond any of us, Mister Mulder. Even my predecessor.",11
MULDER,I want an answer!,4
X,Why kill Duane Barry if there was nothing to hide?,10
MULDER,You mean the government?,4
X,"There are no answers for you, Mister Mulder. They only have one policy... Deny everything.",15
"FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 8",11 A.M.,2
SKINNER,"This is a serious allegation, Agent Mulder.",7
MULDER,So long as it's true.,5
SKINNER,"""Agent Krycek was hired or suborned by an outside agency to impede a federal investigation and may be responsible for the death of a suspect in a capitol murder case.""?",30
MULDER,It goes on.,3
SKINNER,"""And the possible murder of the tram operator at Skyland Mountain."" There's a lot of blood on this document, Agent Mulder. Are you standing behind this, going on the record?",30
MULDER,"Yes, sir.",2
SKINNER,"Then you damn well better have the facts to back it up. I need to see Agent Krycek immediately. I can't protect you, Agent Mulder. Past a point, this will become a larger bureau matter. All right, what do you got?",41
MULDER,"I found this in Agent Krycek's car. He doesn't smoke. Agent Krycek was the last person with Duane Barry before he died. He was also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappeared. When I got to the top of Skyline Mountain, I saw an unmarked helicopter working the area. I believe that Agent Krycek gave away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Agent Scully to whoever he's working with.",73
SKINNER,And who is that?,4
MULDER,"I don't know, the military? Some covert organization within the government? Whoever it is that man who smokes those cigarettes works for.",22
SKINNER,Why?,1
MULDER,"Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever it is they're trying to deny. Because she had hard and damning evidence, that metallic implant in her possession. Or because her termination would prevent further involvement with me and my work.",40
SKINNER,Do you think Agent Scully's dead?,6
MULDER,I don't know. How far do you think they'd go? What do you know about Agent Krycek?,17
SKINNER,"I didn't give him the assignment, I only... Yes. Thank you. Agent Krycek didn't show up for work this morning. His home number has been disconnected.",26
MULDER,"That's it? He's gone, he just disappears into the woodwork?",10
SKINNER,So it would appear.,4
MULDER,Who are these people who can just murder with impunity and we can't do anything about it?,17
SKINNER,"Let it go, Agent Mulder.",5
MULDER,Like hell.,2
SKINNER,There's nothing you can do.,5
MULDER,What can you do about it?,6
SKINNER,"There's only one thing I can do, Agent Mulder. As of right now, I'm reopening the X-Files. That's what they fear the most.",23
MARGARET SCULLY,Agent Mulder? Thank you for calling me.,7
MULDER,I'm sorry I don't have better news.,7
MARGARET SCULLY,Do you know something? Is Dana okay?,7
MULDER,We don't know anything more about her.,7
MARGARET SCULLY,I know you're doing all you can. I had that dream again last night. About Dana being taken away? I can't tell you how it scares me.,27
MULDER,"It's probably scarier when you stop having the dream. Don't you think? I found this. It's something I... I never considered about her. If she was... if she was such a skeptic, why did she wear that?",37
MARGARET SCULLY,I gave it to her on her fifteenth birthday.,9
MULDER,Don't you want to keep it?,6
MARGARET SCULLY,"When you find her, you give it to her.",9
