SKINNER,Agent Scully? Can I see you for a few minutes?,10
SKINNER,Kimberly would you excuse us please?,6
KIMBERLY (THE SECRETARY),Certainly sir.,2
SKINNER,A memo came across my desk last night. I debated whether or not to call you at home but I decided to..,22
SCULLY,And it concerns me?,4
SKINNER,"Yes, and your sister. It's been 5 months and there have been no leads or new evidence on her murder investigation by the DC police team or the Bureau. I've been told the case is to remain inactive until further notice.",41
SCULLY,I see.,2
SKINNER,I don't think there's anything to be read into this. I think it's a case of manpower and workload. I want you to know that I am going to appeal this decision and I am gonna go back over all the evidence again myself and make sure that nothing has been overlooked.,52
SCULLY,"You know, it's strange. Men can blow up buildings, and they can be nowhere near the crime scene but we can piece together the evidence and convict them beyond a doubt. Our labs here can recreate out of the most microscopic detail the motivation and circumstance to almost any murder, right down to a killer's attitude towards his mother and that he was a bed wetter. But in a case of a woman, my sister, who was gunned down in cold blood in a well-lit apartment building by a shooter who left the weapon at the crime scene, we can't even put together enough to keep anybody interested.",108
SKINNER,I don't think this has anything to do with interest.,10
SCULLY,"If I may say so sir, it has everything to do with interest. Just not yours, and not mine.",19
MULDER,Yeah?,1
SCULLY,Sorry I'm late.,3
MULDER,Anything up?,2
SCULLY,No. It's nothing. What did you want to talk to me about?,12
MULDER,"Something interesting came into my attention last night. A French salvage ship, the Piper Maru, limped into port in San Diego yesterday, all the way from the north Pacific.",29
SCULLY,Why is that of interest?,5
MULDER,"Using the national weather service satellite system, I was able to track its course. This was its original position.",19
SCULLY,"Longitude uh.. 171 east, latitude 42 north.",7
MULDER,"Yeah, that's where the boat we know as The Talapus pulled up what you believe was a Russian sub, but what I believe was the remains of a UFO.",29
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"Look Scully, I don't know what it is but something is still down there and now the French are looking for it too.",23
SCULLY,So what?,2
MULDER,So why all the attention paid to this site? What information are they acting on?,15
SCULLY,Why don't you just ask them?,6
MULDER,I would but the entire crew is being treated for radiation burns.,12
SCULLY,From exposure to what?,4
MULDER,The French government is keeping that information classified for some reason.,11
SCULLY,Could it have anything to do with their resumption in nuclear tests?,12
MULDER,I checked. It's thousands of miles away from any test sites. What?,12
SCULLY,"I'm just constantly amazed by you.. you're working down here in the basement, sifting through files and transmissions that any other agent would just throw away in the garbage.",29
MULDER,Well that's why I'm in the basement Scully.,8
SCULLY,"You're in the basement because they're afraid of you, of your relentlessness and because they know that they could drop you in the middle of the desert, and tell you the truth is out there, and you would ask them for a shovel!",43
MULDER,Is that what you think of me?,7
SCULLY,"Well, maybe not a shovel. Maybe a backhoe.",8
MULDER,Well that's good because there's some garbage in San Diego I want you to help me dig through.,18
MULDER,Dr Seizer?,2
MULDER,Special agent Mulder. This is agent Scully.,7
MULDER,"Yeah, how are they doing? to determine a proper course of treatment, because there's an air of secrecy around what happened. The source of their exposure is still undetermined.",29
SCULLY,"These symptoms, would you characterize then as acute or somatic? I'm a medical doctor. it. The effects are degrading rapidly, spontaneous internal bleeding in the mouths and intestinal tracts , blood in the urine. All these men are suffering severe delirium, the pre-advanced stages of coma.",45
SCULLY,What kind of exposure are we talking about here?,9
SCULLY,That's verging on the levels of victims of Hiroshima suffered. like this just don't appear in nature.,17
MULDER,Not on this planet.,4
SCULLY,"Did you get the chance to talk to any of them? for one man, and this was strange because he's the only one who seems to be completely unaffected. I held him for the 1st day, but I detected none of the symptoms of the others. His leukocytes and erythocytes were high. Actually, he was in very good health.",59
MULDER,"How could that be? With that level of radiation, how could one man not be exposed? was the one who piloted the boat in. And none of these men could've done that in their condition.",35
MULDER,"Could it be possible for us to talk to him? He's a Frenchman, has a San Francisco address, his name is Gauthier.",22
A MAN'S VOICE,Ok let's wrap it up and get in the trucks. home number.,12
MULDER,"Try the INS or the French Consulate, see what you can pull up on him. Consulate please?",17
MULDER,"Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.",5
MAN,I'm Wayne Morgan. I'm with the uh Navy's investigative services unit.,11
MULDER,Have you turned anything up?,5
MORGAN,"No nothing, but I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to be looking for.",14
MULDER,The crew of this ship is being treated for radiation.,10
MORGAN,"Yeah we got all that, we had hazmat team poring over the boat, didn't find a trace.",17
SCULLY,Nothing?,1
MORGAN,"We have divers in the water going over the hull, put probes down the bilge. Couldn't detect the slightest level.",20
MULDER,So it's ok for us to go on board?,9
MORGAN,"Sure, you'll probably get more radiation off your cell phone. ON THE BOAT",13
MORGAN TO SCULLY,"Generator's back, is that better?",5
SCULLY,"Yeah, thanks. Is this the way you found this room?",10
MORGAN,"Nothing's been touched, not since you've been tied up here anyway. It's a mess huh?",15
MULDER,Feels like home.,3
SCULLY,"It feels like somebody was looking for something, any idea what?",11
MULDER,"No, I'm looking for the vcr.",6
SCULLY,What for?,2
MULDER,The dive suit has a video camera.,7
MORGAN,What the hell is that?,5
MULDER,Looks like the fuselage of a plane.,7
SCULLY,It's a North American P-51 Mustang.,6
MORGAN,Yeah it sure is.,4
MULDER,I just got very turned on.,6
SCULLY,It's the shape of the canopy. I used to watch my father and brothers put together World War II model planes as a kid.,24
MULDER,Would it have been carrying anything radioactive?,7
SCULLY,No it was just a fighter.,6
MULDER,Then what was it those men exposed to?,8
SCULLY,"I don't know, but I might know somebody I can ask.",11
WOMAN'S VOICE,"You're home! I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me? There were these men from the consulate, they said there've been an accident...Why aren't you answering me? Why aren't you answering me?",35
SCULLY,"Hi, I'm here to see Commander Johansen.",7
MILITARY,Name please?,2
SCULLY,"Special agent Dana Scully, FBI.",5
MILITARY,You have an appointment?,4
SCULLY,"No, uh.. he used to be a friend of my father's. I'm out here from Washington and I wanted to surprise him.",22
MILITARY,Let me give you directions.,5
SCULLY,"I know my way, thanks.",5
MULDER,"Mr Gauthier? Mr Gauthier? open the door, it's the FBI. Mr Gauthier?",12
MULDER,Mr Gauthier? I want you to lie still. I'm with the FBI. What happened?,14
GAUTHIER,"Just fall, I don't know.",5
MULDER,How did you get here?,5
GAUTHIER,I can't remember. I was on the boat.,8
MULDER,The Piper Maru? That's the last thing you remember?,9
GAUTHIER,"Yes, I was on the dive.",6
MULDER,Do you know where you are?,6
GAUTHIER,I'm at home.,3
MULDER,Yeah.,1
GAUTHIER,Where's my wife?,3
MULDER,"Nobody else's home, but somebody has been going over your papers.",11
GAUTHIER,Where's Joan?,2
MULDER,"She's not here, look.. you need to be careful, you have some kind of oil all over you?",18
GAUTHIER,What's going on here?,4
MULDER,"I want you to remain calm, ok? I'd like to ask you a few questions about a letter. About a J. Kallenchuk Salvage Brokers.",24
GAUTHIER,I don't recognize that name.,5
MULDER,"Well, somebody did. And I think you know why.",9
GAUTHIER,I would like to speak with the French Consul General. I have nothing more to say.,16

SCULLY,"I'm Dana Scully, I used to live 3 doors down. My father was Captain William Scully. I went to school with your son..",23

JOHANSEN,Um.. well would you come in. Do sit down.,9
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
JOHANSEN,Would you like something to drink?,6
SCULLY,No thank you. I know that you were an officer in the Pacific during World War II. I wanted to ask you about a plane that's been discovered.,28
JOHANSEN,Discovered?,1
SCULLY,"Yes, a P-51 Mustang at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean with the uh..call numbers JTT0 111470.",17
JOHANSEN,Well those are not the call numbers of a P-51.,10
SCULLY,"There was an illustration on the fuselage with the words ""Drop Dead Red"".",13
JOHANSEN,I'm .. sorry.,2
SCULLY,Would the words Zeus Faber mean anything to you?,9
JOHANSEN,"No.. but as I said, sometimes my memory is not so sharp.",12
SCULLY,Well would you know anybody I might be able to talk to? Somebody who might be able to give me that information?,22
JOHANSEN,I wish I could help you.,6
SCULLY,"I wish you could too. There's a number of French sailors who may die from radiation exposure. If we knew more about the plane, we might be able to understand why. Anyway.. it was very good to see you again sir.",41
JOHANSEN,Oh say hello to your father for me.,8
SCULLY,"I wish I could, he's passed away.",7
JOHANSEN,I'm very sorry.,3

WOMAN,"Sure, the Far East.",4
MULDER,Well I've got a letter here typed on his stationary. Maybe you typed it for him.,16
WOMAN,Sorry I don't type. What did you say your name was again?,12
MULDER,Mulder.,1
WOMAN,"Mr Mulder I'd be happy to relay any messages you have for him, but I really have no way of contacting Mr Kallenchuk just now.",25
MULDER,"Ok well, why don't you have him call me as soon as he can.",14
WOMAN,"Sure, the FBI.",3
MULDER,"Yes, what did you say your name was?",8
WOMAN,Geraldine.,1
MULDER,Thank you Geraldine.,3
MILITARY,"Agent Scully, would you step off the car please?",9

JOHANSEN,"We bury our dead alive, don't we?",7
SCULLY,I don't know if I understand.,6

MULDER,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me, where are you?",6
MULDER,"San Francisco airport, where are you?",6
SCULLY,"Miramar Airbase. I think I've just found out what those men were exposed to, what the Piper Maru was out there looking for.",23
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"That P-51 Mustang was part of an escort for a B-20 carrying an atomic bomb, just like the one we dropped on Hiroshima. Only this one never reached its target.",30
MULDER,Says who?,2
SCULLY,"Says one of the men originally sent to find it, on a submarine called the Zeus Faber.",17
MULDER,That was the name we saw written on that dive chart right?,12
SCULLY,"It all makes sense Mulder, why would they build a nuclear weapon when they can salvage one?",17
MULDER,"Why if they knew about it, why wait 50 years to try to recover it? And why was the only person not exposed, the diver, sent down to find it.",30
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MULDER,Why don't you try to find out?,7
SCULLY,What about you?,3
MULDER,I gotta go to Hong Kong.,6
SCULLY,Hong Kong?,2
MULDER,"Yeah, look, uh.. I'm gonna miss my flight, so uh... I gotta call you back ok?",16
WAITRESS,Hi.,1
MIB#1,Anything good here? Anything not on the menu?,8
SKINNER,You'll have to ask the waitress. You gentleman have a problem?,11
MIB#1,"When something is not on the menu Mr Skinner, there's usually a reason, wouldn't you say?",16
SKINNER,I'm sorry I didn't came here for conversation.,8
MIB#2,"A hierarchy exists in the FBI, isn't that right? A man has status, like yourself, you're assistant director, those under him obey his orders, right?",25
SKINNER,Who are you guys?,4
MIB#1,We work with the intelligence community.,6
SKINNER,Remind me not to move there.,6
MIB#1,"You take your orders like those below you, Mr Skinner. A case is made inactive, the death of an FBI agent's sister, maybe that's because those above you have done the hard work of arriving at that decision.",38
SKINNER,"Thanks for the enlightenment, I'm gonna go now.",8
MIB#1,"It helps to know these things when a man looks forward to his career, to his plan for future.",19
JOHANSEN,We'd all joined thinking we'd come home heroes. That's me. The rest of the men of the picture...a month later they were all dead. The madness we planned to unleash on the Japanese...we ended up setting it loose on ourselves.,40
SCULLY,Radiation killed all those men?,5
JOHANSEN,"The men you say had burns on their bodies.. that's how it began with us. Awful burns. destroyer moved into the area.. but rather than attempt to return home, Captain Sanford ordered us to go to silent running. After 3 days the burns started to appear. Baker got them first, then Vorce and Innocenti. No one had seen burns like these before. But a lot of us began to suspect they had to do with the planes that we'd been sent to recover. The men were all frightened to die. As the X.O. I urged the captain to return to port but against all reason and good sense, he refused to leave the area.",114
MAN,"Captain Sanford, I'm not an MD but I know a lost cause when I see one, these men are all dying and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.",31
SANFORD,Just do your damn job.,5
MAN,"Sir I'm trying, but if we stay down here any longer, none of us are going home.",17
MAN (WHISPERING),"Johansen, you've gotta get us to the surface .",8
JOHANSEN,We are under the captain's orders.,6
MAN,He's losing his mind.,4
JOHANSEN,The Japanese are shadowing us. That destroyer is doing wide circles above our position.,14
MAN,"You have to take control of this sub sir, you have to make a decision.",15
ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE,"We're all gonna die! All of us, we're dying, can't you all see that? You've gotta get us outta here the only command that could save us from the Japanese destroyer now was the command to return home, an order I knew the captain would never issue..",47
SANFORD,Johansen! Open this door! Open this door! Johansen!,8
JOHANSEN (VOICE OVER),"I knew mutiny was our only chance for survival. But I also knew, by sealing that door, I was sealing the fate of the men I locked behind it.",29
JOHANSEN,"By luck, or the grace of God, we made it to Pearl Harbor.",13
SCULLY,What happened to Sanford and the sick crew men?,9
JOHANSEN,"When they opened that door, those who weren't dead were dying. There were 144 men on that boat, only 7 of us had survived. Whatever killed then, I was allowed to live, to raise a family, to grow old. None of us never got an explanation why.",47
MULDER,"Is this seat taken Miss Kallenchuk? Geraldine Kallenchuk, isn't it?",10
GERALDINE,"Jerry, with a J.",4
MULDER,"I noticed you flew 1st class, must be good money selling classified government secrets.",14
GERALDINE,"It's a bull market, hon, and I'm Miss Popular. Let's make a deal.",13
MULDER,How much for the location of that P-51 Mustang you sold the French government?,14
GERALDINE,Why should I tell you?,5
MULDER,Actually I'd rather know who sold you the secret.,9
GERALDINE,"I'm a middle man Mr Mulder, pardon my gender type. I take a cut, then slice off the top. It would be bad business to divulge my sources.",28
MULDER,Why did you run off to Hong Kong?,8
GERALDINE,To meet the buyer.,4
MULDER,To sell him what?,4
GERALDINE,Pardon your gender type.,4
MULDER,Oh your buyer's a woman.,5
GERALDINE,"Actually you know, it's none of your damn business.",9
MULDER,Actually you know it is my damn business because whatever you're selling is killing half a dozen sailors in a California Hospital. Which is why I'm gonna arrest you.,29
GERALDINE,"Arrest me? With what? Your chopsticks? This is Hong Kong Mr Mulder, they don't allow handguns here, they took yours away.. at the airport. Hey! Hey! You can't do that!",30
MULDER,"I just did it, now let's make a deal.",9
GERALDINE,You are violating my civil rights.,6
MULDER,You gave up your civil rights when you committed treason.,10
GERALDINE,You can't force me to do anything.,7
MULDER,"Open it. Pardon my gender type, but after you. Where are the lights?",13
MAN'S VOICE,Right here.,2
MULDER,Krycek. I thought guns were against the law here.,9
KRYCEK,You know what they say when guns are outlawed...,9
MULDER,Why don't you take that gun and shoot yourself in your head like you shot my father?,17
GERALDINE,Great.. High Noon in Hong Kong.,6
KRYCEK,Aw... why don't you SHUT UP!,6
GERALDINE,My God!,2
MULDER,"It's no way to treat your business partner, especially since she's been moving those secrets you've been selling so well.",20
KRYCEK,Looks like she's your partner now.,6
MULDER,Damn.,1
MAN'S VOICE,"Au fond a gauche. Allez on s'depeche, on s'depeche. Il est parti. Allez on s'depeche vite, allez les gars on y va.",22
SKINNER,Is the coffee hot?,4
WAITRESS,Yeah.,1
SKINNER,How's the blue plate?,4
WAITRESS,Looks good.,2
SKINNER,I'll have one medium rare please. phone that's out of order nobody complains? I'm complaining.,15
WAITRESS,"I'm sorry sir, I'm sure it's been called in.",9
MAN,"You're sure? Meanwhile, I'm going to miss the phone call. That's gonna cost me time and money..Who's gonna call that in?",21
WAITRESS,"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what else to say.",10
MAN,Say you're gonna pay me.. the 1.75 the phone ate.,10
WAITRESS,No you'll have to deal with the phone company sir.,10
MAN,"You'll deal with 'em, I want my money.",8
SKINNER,Is there a problem there?,5
MAN,Yeah there is a big problem.,6
MAN,"Chupa dura , amigo.",3

KRYCEK,"Come on, finish it Mulder, c'mon finish it, come on.",10
MULDER,I want that digital tape.,5
KRYCEK,I don't have it.,4
MULDER,"Like hell you don't, it contains the secrets you were selling as well as everything else our government knows about the existence of extra terrestrial life .",26
KRYCEK,How could I sell anything? The tape's encrypted.,8
MULDER,"Obviously, you found a way.",5
KRYCEK,I don't have it...I'll give it to you if you let me go.,13
MULDER,Where is it?,3
KRYCEK,"DC... in a locker. No. If you let me go, I'll tell you.",13
MULDER,"You put that tape in my hands and we'll talk about it. Why don't you go to the bathrooms and clean yourself off? If you're not out of there in 3 minutes, I'm coming in there to kill you.",39
MULDER,Feel better?,2
KRYCEK,Like a new man.,4
