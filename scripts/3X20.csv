ROKY CRIKENSON,"Yeah, this is Roky. I checked all the connections. I don't know why all the power's down out here. I'm going to have to come in and get some more equipment. Yeah, yeah... yeah, I'll need several of those. All right...",41
HAROLD LAMB,"Um... I don't want to scare you, but... I think I'm madly in love with you. I mean, you're all I think about. You're my whole world.",27
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"Harold, I like you a lot too, but this is our first date. I mean, I think that we need more time to get to know one another. What happened?",30
HAROLD LAMB,Oh my God... oh my God...,6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"Harold, what are those things?",5
HAROLD LAMB,How the hell should I know?,6
ALIEN,Jack... what is that thing?,5
ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN,How the hell should I know?,6
JOSE CHUNG,"I had never thought much about it before. I guess that's because I always felt like such an alien myself. That to be concerned with aliens from... other planets, that just seemed so, uh... redundant.",35
SCULLY,"Well, I'd never actually much considered it myself before I started this job.",13
JOSE CHUNG,"Yes. Now, if I understand it correctly, your partner is the, uh, actual expert?",14
SCULLY,"Yes, and I feel that I must apologize for his refusal to speak with you, Mister Chung, but, uh, I must admit, I probably wouldn't have myself if I wasn't such an admirer of your work.",36
JOSE CHUNG,Oh!,1
SCULLY,"""The Lonely Buddha"" is one of my favorite novels.",9
JOSE CHUNG,And hear I was thinking you were just some... brainy beauty. Now I find out that you also have good taste.,21
SCULLY,What made you decide to write a book about an alien abduction if you're not that interested in the subject yourself?,21
JOSE CHUNG,"Actually? It was my publisher's idea. At first I was reluctant, until I realized that I had an opportunity here to create an entirely new literary genre... a non-fiction science fiction. Now, see, that gimmick alone will guarantee it's landing on the best-seller list. In short, to answer your question? Money.",51
SCULLY,Well... just as long as you're attempting to record the truth.,11
JOSE CHUNG,"Oh, God, no. How can I possibly do that?",9
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
JOSE CHUNG,"I spent three months in Klass County and everybody there has a different version of what truly happened. Truth is as subjective as reality. That will help explain why when people talk about their ""UFO experiences,"" they always start off with ""well, now, I know how crazy this is going to sound... but.""",53
SCULLY,So you're here to get my version of the truth?,10
JOSE CHUNG,"Exactly. Now, when did you first find out about the case?",11
SCULLY,"Well... not right away, of course. Um... not enough time had elapsed for it to be considered a missing person's case before the girl was found the following morning.",29
SCULLY,"She was suffering from what my partner calls ""missing time."" She recalled nothing of the previous night, nor how she had arrived at her present whereabouts. Her body exhibited signs of physical abuse, and all of her clothes were on backwards or inside-out.",43
JOSE CHUNG,"Have I had my share of mornings like that. Oh, but these have the characteristics of someone who has... Uh, do you prefer the term ""abductee"" or ""experiencer?""",28
SCULLY,"Actually, I prefer neither, but my partner uses ""abductee.""",9
JOSE CHUNG,"My preference is for the other. ""I've just had a, uh... little alien experience."" As opposed to, ""I've just been abducted!""",21
SCULLY,"Well, regardless, the girl was considered neither at the time. She appeared more to be the victim of date rape than anything else. She was given a physical exam and her statement was taken. Later that night, she received her... visitation.",41
HAROLD LAMB,"Oh, Chrissy, thank God you're all right.",7
CHRISSY GIORGIO,How dare you come here.,5
HAROLD LAMB,"Chrissy, I did everything I could.",6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"Don't I know it, you bastard.",6
HAROLD LAMB,Chrissy! Don't you remember?,4
FATHER,What the hell is going on up there?,8
HAROLD LAMB,Chrissy! I love you!,4
SCULLY,"The father informed the police, who apprehended the boy back at his own home.",14
HAROLD LAMB,We... we were abducted by aliens.,6
MANNERS,You don't sound so sure of it.,7
HAROLD LAMB,"It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy doesn't remember it.",14
MANNERS,You're willing to take a lie detector test to prove you were abducted by creatures from outer space?,18
HAROLD LAMB,"Yes, I am.",3
MANNERS,"Well, too bad! 'Cause I don't need no lie detector to tell me the only thing you were abducted by were your rampaging hormones, you punk!",26
JOSE CHUNG,But he did take a test and passed it?,9
SCULLY,And he stuck to his story... until we got there.,10
HAROLD LAMB,"If she says I raped her, then... I guess I raped her.",12
MULDER,You don't sound so sure of that.,7
HAROLD LAMB,"It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy remembers it that way.",15
MULDER,Would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that you raped her?,16
HAROLD LAMB,"No, I'm not.",3
MULDER,"Well, that's too bad. Because the next rape you experience will probably be your own... in prison.",17
SCULLY,"That should have ended our investigation, but Mulder brought the girl in for questioning.",14
MULDER,"Are you having trouble sleeping? Are you experiencing muscle pains? Vision problems? Nose bleeds? When you look at a particular object, do you receive the sudden flash that you're actually looking at something else? An alien's face?",37
CHRISSY GIORGIO,Yes!,1
SCULLY,"So, my partner became convinced that she was suffering from what he calls ""post-abduction syndrome.""",15
JOSE CHUNG,You don't believe in the disorder?,6
SCULLY,"Well, I think that stress of any kind can cause all of those physical ailments. In any case, Mulder convinced the girl and her parents to let her be hypnotized.",30
JOSE CHUNG,What is your opinion of hypnosis?,6
SCULLY,"I know that it has its therapeutic value, but it has never been proven to enhance memory. In fact, it actually worsens it since, since, since people in that state or prone to confabulation.",34
JOSE CHUNG,"When I was doing research for my book ""The Caligarian Candidate...""",11
SCULLY,One of the greatest thrillers ever written.,7
JOSE CHUNG,"Oh... Thank you. I was, uh... interested in how the C.I.A., when conducting their MK-Ultra mind control experiments back in the '50s, had no idea how hypnosis went.",28
SCULLY,Hmm.,1
JOSE CHUNG,Or what it was.,4
SCULLY,No one still knows.,4
JOSE CHUNG,"Still, as a storyteller, I'm fascinated how a person's sense of consciousness can be... so transformed by nothing more magical than listening to words. Mere words.",26
FINGERS,"You are feeling very sleepy, very relaxed. As your body calmly drifts deeper and deeper into a state of peaceful relaxation, you will respond only to the sound of my voice. Chrissy? Can you recall where you are?",38
CHRISSY GIORGIO,I'm in a room... on a spaceship... surrounded by aliens.,10
FINGERS,What do the aliens look like?,6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,They're small... but their heads and their eyes are big. They're gray.,12
FINGERS,Are you alone?,3
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"No, Harold's on another table... but he seems really out of it... like he's not really there.",17
FINGERS,What are the aliens doing now?,6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,They're sort of arguing. I sort of hear them but I can't understand what they're saying. Except the leader. I can understand him.,23
FINGERS,"When the leader speaks to you, does his mouth move?",10
CHRISSY GIORGIO,No. But I hear him in my head.,8
FINGERS,What is he saying?,4
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"He's telling me this is for the good of my planet, but...",12
FINGERS,But what?,2
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"I don't like what he's doing. It's like he's inside my mind, like... like he's stealing my memories.",18
MULDER,"The description of the aliens, the physical exam, the mindscan, the presence of another human being that appears switched off, it's all characteristic of a typical abduction.",27
SCULLY,"That's my problem with it, Mulder. It's all a little too typical. Abduction lore has become so prevalent in our society that you can ask someone to imagine what it would be like to be abducted and they'd concoct an identical scenario.",42
MULDER,"Yeah, if it were only one person, Scully, but we have two individuals here, each verifying the other's story.",19
MANNERS,"Well, thanks a lot! You really bleeped up this case.",10
SCULLY,"Well, of course, he didn't actually say ""bleeped."" He said...",10
JOSE CHUNG,"I'm, uh, familiar with, uh, Detective Manners' colorful phraseology.",9
MULDER,You still going to hold the boy?,7
MANNERS,"Oh, you bet your blankety-blank bleep I am.",8
MULDER,But the victim seems to confirm his alibi.,8
MANNERS,The hell she did! Those kids' stories couldn't be more bleeping different.,12
HAROLD,Chrissy! Chrissy! What do you want with us? What do you want with us?!,14
MULDER,How did the alien respond?,5
HAROLD LAMB,Well... all he did was...,5
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"What, what's happening?",3
HAROLD LAMB,"Don't worry, it'll okay. I'm here to protect you. I'll never let anything happen to you.",16
MULDER,"What was the other alien, the gray, what was it doing during all this.",14
HAROLD LAMB,He was just... talking.,4
MULDER,Telepathically?,1
HAROLD LAMB,No. In english. He just kept saying the same thing over and over again.,14
ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN,This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening...,16
HAROLD LAMB,Would you shut up already? No! No!,7
ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN,This is not happening. This is not happening.,8
HAROLD LAMB,"I don't know where I was taken, because the whole time I was like this, in pain.",17
MULDER,Because the other alien was conducting torturous experiments on you?,10
HAROLD LAMB,"No... no, it was like... you know, you know when you were a kid and you tore the legs off a bug for no reason? I guess I was the bug. Anyways, the next thing I remember, I was suddenly outside... like I was flying through the air or something.",50
MULDER,Then what?,2
HAROLD LAMB,"And then I think I hit the ground. When I came to, I, I immediately ran to Chrissy's to make sure she was there and that she was okay.",29
SCULLY,Harold... did you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse that night?,12
HAROLD LAMB,"If her father finds out, I'm a dead man.",9
MULDER,He said it happened before the abduction. So what if they had sex?,13
SCULLY,"So we know that it wasn't an alien who probed her. Mulder, you've got two kids having sex before they're mature enough to know how to handle it.",28
MULDER,So you're saying that all this is just a case of sexual trauma?,13
SCULLY,"It's a lot more plausible than an alien abduction, especially in light of their contradictory stories.",16
MANNERS,Hey! I just got a call from some crazy bleep-head saying he was an eyewitness to this alien abduction. Do you feel like talking to this blank-hole?,27
ROKY CRIKENSON,"I know how crazy all this sounds, but I don't care. What I have to say has to be said.",20
SCULLY,Why did you wait till now to tell us this information? Two kids' lives may be affected by it.,19
ROKY CRIKENSON,"Well, it, it's bigger than a couple of kids. It has to do with the entire planet... the universe and who knows what else!",24
MULDER,Why don't you tell us what happened that night?,9
ROKY CRIKENSON,"This. It's all here. After seeing what I saw that night, I rushed right home and wrote it all down. Forty-eight hours straight. I didn't want to forget a single detail. But I feel that I should warn you, I don't want to be overly dramatic here, but by looking at this, you're putting your lives in danger.",58
MULDER,Why is that?,3
ROKY CRIKENSON,"Because last night, the weirdest thing happened.",7
1ST MAN IN BLACK,No other object as been misidentified as a flying saucer more often than the planet Venus.,16
ROKY CRIKENSON,Really? That was when I realized something was weird.,9
SCULLY,At which point?,3
ROKY CRIKENSON,"See, normally, if two strangers drive into my garage, I tell them to get the hell off the property. But this time, I didn't! It was like I was in a trance or something.",34
MULDER,What did these men look like?,6
ROKY CRIKENSON,"Usually, I'm really good with faces, but this time, all I can remember is how they were dressed. They were...",20
MULDER,All in black?,3
ROKY CRIKENSON,How'd you know that?,4
MULDER,"Since the '50s, people who have had close encounters have reported subsequent visits by these unearthly men in black.",19
JOSE CHUNG,"But you know, myths about men in black garments......have been recorded throughout history in many different cultures. The Celtic legends are filled with trickster men in black and how anyone who encounters them becomes enchanted.",35
SCULLY,"Unfortunately, I'm not sure that modern reconstruction of ancient fairy tales lends any more credence to Roky's testimony.",18
1ST MAN IN BLACK,"Even the former leader of your United States of America, James Earl Carter Jr., thought he saw a UFO once... But it's been proven he only saw the planet Venus.",30
ROKY CRIKENSON,I'm a republican.,3
1ST MAN IN BLACK,"Venus was at its peak brilliance last night. You probably thought you saw something up in the sky other than Venus, but I assure you, it was Venus.",28
ROKY CRIKENSON,I know... What I saw.,5
1ST MAN IN BLACK,"Your scientists have yet to discover how neural networks create self-consciousness, let alone how the human brain processes two-dimensional retinal images into the three-dimensional phenomenon known as perception. Yet you somehow brazenly declare seeing is believing? Mister Crikenson, your scientific illiteracy makes me shudder, and I wouldn't flaunt your ignorance by telling anyone that you saw anything last night other than the planet Venus, because if you do, you're a dead man.",72
ROKY CRIKENSON,You... can't threaten me.,4
1ST MAN IN BLACK,I just did.,3
ROKY CRIKENSON,"This is what they wanted me not to show anyone. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go pack.",20
MULDER,"If we have any more questions, where can we find you?",11
ROKY CRIKENSON,You won't find me.,4
MULDER,""" I sat in my stalled truck, frozen in terror, watching as this third alien attacked the other two gray aliens. And then it happened, the thing that forever changed my life...",31
LORD KINBOTE,Roky! Roky! Be thou not afraid! No harm will come unto thee.,12
ROKY CRIKENSON,"Wh, what do you want from me?",7
LORD KINBOTE,Your efforts are needed for the survival of all earthlings.,10
ROKY CRIKENSON,How can I do that?,5
LORD KINBOTE,Come. I shall showeth...,4
MULDER,"""...thee. Before I knew it, I was aboard the hover vessel and was not heading into outer space, but inner space, heading towards the earth's molten core. For that is the domain of the third alien, whose name, he soon told me... was Lord Kinbote.""",45
SCULLY,"In short, Roky showed signs of being what is known as a fantasy-prone personality.",14
JOSE CHUNG,"Agent Scully, you are so kindhearted. He's a nut! I just read his manifesto!",14
SCULLY,How did you get a copy?,6
JOSE CHUNG,One was sent to my publishers. I don't know what was more disturbing... his description of the inner core reincarnated souls sex orgy... or the fact that the whole thing is written in screenplay format.,35
SCULLY,It definitely was peculiar.,4
JOSE CHUNG,"Well, surely, your partner didn't believe any of it?",9
SCULLY,"Wh, wh, well, Mulder's had his share of peculiar notions. He's not inclined to dismiss anything outright. Mulder, you're nuts!",20
MULDER,"I'm not saying he isn't delusional, I'm just suggesting that his delusional state was triggered by something he actually witnessed that night. And the first part of his story verifies the boy's version. In fact, the only version that doesn't add up is the girl's.",45
SCULLY,Who are you calling?,4
MULDER,I'm going to arrange to have her re-hypnotized.,8
SCULLY,Re-hypnotized? What for?,3
MULDER,To see if what she remembers is really what she remembers.,11
FINGERS,"You are feeling very sleepy, very relaxed. As your body calmly drifts deeper and deeper into a state of peaceful relaxation, you will respond only to the sound of my voice.",31
SCULLY,"So the girl was put under again to see if she could confirm any of the boy's story. And as I suspected she might under such conditions, she did.",29
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"The whole time it's beating me, I'm like this. And then I, I'm flying through the air.",17
FINGERS,Now what's happening?,3
CHRISSY GIORGIO,Some men are lifting me off the ground... men in Air Force uniforms.,13
MULDER,Air Force?,2
FINGERS,"Where are you now, Chrissy?",5
CHRISSY GIORGIO,"I'm in a room. In an office. I'm surrounded by men. Some are in uniforms, some are in suits.",19
FINGERS,What is he saying?,4
HAND,"You're feeling very sleepy, very relaxed.",6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,I don't remember.,3
FINGERS,What are the other men doing?,6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,They seem to be arguing.,5
AIR FORCE MAN #1,Ask her if this third alien had a Russian accent.,10
CIA MAN #1,This is way beyond their capabilities. This is way beyond our capabilities.,12
CIA MAN #2,Ask if she knows where the gray alien's saucer went to.,11
CIA MAN #1,How is she going to know that?,7
AIR FORCE MAN #1,Have we located any of the others?,7
CIA MAN #2,We're combing the area but this weather makes it tough.,10
CIA MAN #1,All right. Rinse her out and give her the usual abduction rigmarole.,12
FINGERS,What is the doctor doing now?,6
CHRISSY GIORGIO,He's telling me this is for the good of my country. I don't like what he's doing. He's stealing my memories.,21
SCULLY,"Mulder, I think you and the hypnotherapist were leading her and I think there was more confabulation in the second version than in the first.",25
MULDER,"No, I think you're wrong about that, Scully. But I do think you're right about one thing, that this case might not have anything to do with aliens.",28
MANNERS,"Hey, I just got a call from some crazy blankety-blank claiming he found a real live dead alien body.",19
BLAINE FAULKNER,"I know how crazy this is going to sound, but... I want to be abducted by aliens.",17
JOSE CHUNG,Why? Whatever for?,3
BLAINE FAULKNER,I hate this town. I hate... people. I just want to be taken away to someplace where I... I don't have to worry about finding a job.,27
JOSE CHUNG,So you were out in the field that night?,9
BLAINE FAULKNER,"Looking for UFOs. There had been some recent sightings so I was just hoping to stumble across one. Now, I've read every book ever written about UFOs and aliens, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. I should've known to just go get my video camera then instead of notifying the proper authorities.",56
JOSE CHUNG,What was wrong with doing that?,6
BLAINE FAULKNER,"Because the proper authorities showed up with a couple of men in black. One of them was disguised as a woman, but wasn't pulling it off. Like, her hair was red but it was a little too red, you know? And the other one... the tall, lanky one... his face was so blank and expressionless. He didn't even seem human. I, I think he was a mandroid. The only time he reacted was when he saw the dead body.",79
MANNERS,"Yeah, that's a bleeping dead alien body if I ever bleeping saw one.",13
SCULLY,Wrap it up.,3
OFFICER,You got him?,3
SCULLY,"You never saw this. This didn't happen. You tell anyone, you're a dead man. He said I said what?",19
JOSE CHUNG,"When I interviewed him, he claimed you threatened him.",9
SCULLY,"That's ridiculous! I'm... and besides, we allowed him to view the autopsy.",12
BLAINE FAULKNER,Whoa!,1
MANNERS,"Hey, hey!",2
BLAINE FAULKNER,You can't suppress the truth! The people have a right to know! Roswell... Roswell!,14
MULDER,Hey! Does that video camera work?,6
YAPPI,Is this actual footage of an alien autopsy? Or simply a well-made hoax?,13
JOSE CHUNG,So this is footage of the actual autopsy you performed.,10
SCULLY,This is so embarrassing. A picture of Yappi is in the lower corner. Chung presses play.),16
YAPPI,Who is that mysterious man who seems to be overseeing the proceedings? And what secret government agency does this autopsy doctor work for?,23
SCULLY,But see? Whoever got ahold of this footage edited it in such a way as to delete all the significant findings. There appear to be two layers of epidermis. There's a metal strip that runs just under the top layer down the... It's a zipper.,45
BLAINE FAULKNER,"You mean it, it's... it's just a dead human being? Well...",11
MANNERS,"Well, then who is this bleep?",6
MULDER,"I don't know, but I bet we can find his I.D. from the, uh, military database. Have you seen our video cameraman?",22
SCULLY,"No, but I found our alien's I.D. You were right, Mulder. Air Force Major Robert Vallee.",16
MULDER,That was fast.,3
AIR FORCE MAN,Agent Mulder? We were notified one of our officers was confined here under your custody.,15
MULDER,Who notified you?,3
AIR FORCE MAN,"Major Vallee is AWOL, sir. Our orders are to escort him back to the base.",15
SCULLY,"Well, the major is dead. His body is being detained for further investigation.",13
AIR FORCE MAN,"Investigation into what, ma'am?",4
MULDER,Possible kidnapping.,2
AIR FORCE MAN,May we at least view the body for verification?,9
SCULLY,I don't see why no...,5
MULDER,"No, no, no, but you can talk to the other AWOL pilot that was brought in with him.",18
AIR FORCE MAN,Lieutenant Jack Schaffer is also in your custody?,8
MULDER,"That's right. Yeah, he's, he's, he's right down... Here. Oh. He, he was, he was here just a few minutes ago. I, I... I guess he's still AWOL. You want to take a look at Vallee?",36
AIR FORCE MAN,Hmmm. Guess he's still AWOL.,5
SCULLY,So what else is new?,5
MULDER,I got to find that video guy.,7
SCULLY,The wound is situated to the left of the midline abdomen. The edges of the tissue appear...,17
BLAINE FAULKNER,"Who is it? Hey! You just can't... what do you think you're doing? Hey, I... Hey! You have no right to suppress th... Roswell! Roswell! Ros... I was unconscious for... I don't know how long. And the only reason I came to was...",43
MULDER,Where's the tape?,3
BLAINE FAULKNER,They took it.,3
MULDER,Who?,1
BLAINE FAULKNER,The other men in black.,5
MULDER,"If I find out you lied to me, you're a dead man.",12
BLAINE FAULKNER,And that's when he left. I never saw any of them again.,12
JOSE CHUNG,Aren't you nervous telling me all this after receiving all those death threats?,13
BLAINE FAULKNER,"Well, I didn't, I didn't spend all those years playing Dungeons and Dragons and not learn a little something about courage.",21
JOSE CHUNG,Oh. Mm-hmm.,2
SCULLY,"After not recovering the tape, Mulder was heading back to the motel and that's when his account of things gets a little... odd.",23
MULDER,Lieutenant Jack Schaffer?,3
JACK SCHAFFER,This is not happening! It's not happening! This is not happening. It's not happening. It's not happening. Used to project the image of the Virgin Mary over the French trenches in World War One. The enemy's always willing to fire upon an invading force... but on a holy miracle?,49
MULDER,Or on visitors from outer space?,6
JACK SCHAFFER,"Yeah, the enemy sees an American recon plane, they start shooting. They see a flying saucer from another galaxy... they hesitate. You know what happens to most people after seeing a UFO?",32
MULDER,"They experience ""missing time.""",4
JACK SCHAFFER,"Any number of ""soft option kills"" will do... nerve gas... low frequency infrasound beams... Hell, with high-powered microwaves, you can not only cut enemy communications, you can cook internal organs.",30
MULDER,But abductions?,2
JACK SCHAFFER,"Don't know as much about them. I'm just the pilot. You ever flown a flying saucer? Afterwards, sex seems trite.",20
MULDER,But what do you do with the abductees?,8
JACK SCHAFFER,"Take them back to the base. Let the doctors work on them. Nothing physical, they just mess with their minds.",20
MULDER,Hypnosis.,1
JACK SCHAFFER,"At the base, I've seen people go into an ordinary room with an ordinary bunch of doctors... and come out absolutely positive they were probed by aliens.",27
MULDER,"But if abductions are just a covert intelligence operation and UFOs are merely secret military airships, piloted by aliens such as yourself... then what were you abducted by?",28
JACK SCHAFFER,"Don't you get it? I'm absolutely positive me, my copilot, and those two kids were abducted but I can't be absolutely sure it happened. I can't be sure of anything anymore!",31
MULDER,What do you mean?,4
JACK SCHAFFER,I'm not sure we're even having this conversation. I don't know if these mashed potatoes are really here. I don't know if you even exist.,25
MULDER,I can only assure you that I do.,8
JACK SCHAFFER,"Well... thanks, buddy. Unfortunately... I can't give you the same assurance about me. Well, looks like I'm a dead man.",20
MULDER,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. It can't all be fake memory implantations. What about that third alien? What, what was that thing?",23
JACK SCHAFFER,Who? Lord Kinbote?,3
SOLDIER,"Right, come on.",3
JOSE CHUNG,"That is odd. Because almost every day I was there, I ate lunch at that diner and became dear friends with the cook. He told me a story about the night you're talking about. A man walked into his place...",40
MULDER,Sweet potato pie.,3
JOSE CHUNG,"Sat down, ordered sweet potato pie, identified himself as F.B.I. Agent Mulder. He then questioned my friend.",17
MULDER,You ever seen a UFO in these parts?,8
JOSE CHUNG,"He then ordered piece after piece, each time asking another question.",11
MULDER,"You ever experienced a period of ""missing time?"" You ever had the suspicion that you've been abducted by aliens? Have you ever found a metal implant in your body? Have you checked everywhere?",33
JOSE CHUNG,"He ate a whole pie in that fashion, then got up and left. My friend never saw him again. The cook never mentioned Lieutenant Schaffer, let alone any other Air Force personnel. You seem non-nonplused by these contradictions?",38
SCULLY,"Well, not after what happened when Mulder left the diner and got back to the motel.",16
MULDER,Scully? Where's Scully?,3
1ST MAN IN BLACK,"Oh. She, uh... she went to get some ice.",9
MULDER,"Where is she?! Scully, what's going on here?",8
SCULLY,"Mulder, these gentlemen have something very important to tell you.",10
1ST MAN IN BLACK,Some alien encounters are hoaxes perpetrated by your government to manipulate the public. Some of these hoaxes are intentionally revealed to manipulate the truth-seekers who become discredited if they disclose the deliberately absurd deception.,34
MULDER,"Similar things are said about the men in black. That they purposely dress and behave strangely so that if anyone tries to describe an encounter with them, they come off sounding like a lunatic.",34
1ST MAN IN BLACK,I find absolutely no reason why anyone would think you crazy if you described this meeting of ours.,18
2ND MAN IN BLACK,"You're feeling very sleepy, very... relaxed.",6
JOSE CHUNG,Alex Trebek? The game show host?,6
SCULLY,Mulder didn't say that it was Alex Trebek. It was just someone that looked incredibly like him.,17
JOSE CHUNG,"Did he? I mean, you were there.",7
SCULLY,"Well, not exactly, I'm... I don't have any recollection of this. I... was surprised to wake up the next morning with Mulder asleep in my room. But, Mulder... I, I don't even remember letting you in.",36
MULDER,"I told you, you didn't let me in. They were already here.",12
SCULLY,Scully. We'll be right there. That was Detective Manners. He said they just found your bleeping UFO.,17
MANNERS,"Apparently, that was the cause of all those UFO sightings three nights ago. They refused our assistance because it's some kind of top secret, experimental plane.",26
MULDER,They don't want assistance. They want witnesses to their alibi.,10
OFFICER,"Excuse me, ma'am.",3
MANNERS,Hey! That was the guy that was... Bleep.,8
SCULLY,I know it probably doesn't have the sense of closure that you want... but it has more than some of our other cases.,23
JOSE CHUNG,Agent Mulder?,2
MULDER,Thanks.,1
JOSE CHUNG,"What can I do for you, Agent Mulder?",8
MULDER,"Don't write this book. You'll perform a disservice through a field of inquiry that has always struggled for respectability. You're a gifted writer, but no amount of talent could describe the events that occurred in any realistic vein because they deal with alternative realities that we've yet to comprehend. And when presented in the wrong way, in the wrong context, the incidents and the people involved in them can appear foolish, if not downright psychotic. I also know that your publishing house is owned by Warden White, Incorporated... a subsidiary of MacDougall-Kesler, which makes me suspect a covert agenda for your book on the part of the military-industrial-entertainment complex.",109

HAROLD LAMB,I just wanted to tell you I still love you.,10
