MAN,He's not here! He's not here! He's not down there! He swum out and is going to shore!,18
SCULLY,"Get down, stay down! You're going to keep breathing. Do you hear me?",13
WOMAN,Hey! He's getting away!,4
SCULLY,I'll be right back. Back away! Back... I need an E.M.T. in here now!,14
POLICE OFFICER,"Car thirty-nine, requesting an E.M.T....",5
BARTENDER,"Come on, let her through, let her through.)",8
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
BARTENDER,Help me with this table.,5
SCULLY,"We've got paramedics on the way. You're going to the hospital. You're going to be okay. Look, we still haven't celebrated my birthday, Pendrell. I'm not going to let you off the hook like this.",35
BARTENDER,"Let them through, let them through, please.",7
SCULLY,This man has a puncture wound to his right lung. He needs to be intubated immediately. He's an F.B.I. agent... and he's not going to die. Sit down.,28
LOUIS FRISH,I'm sorry. How did they know?,6
SCULLY,"When you talked to your girlfriend, what did you say? Did you tell her you were in D.C.?",18
LOUIS FRISH,No.,1
SCULLY,Then there's someone inside.,4
SKINNER,What happened? Who shot Pendrell?,5
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
SKINNER,I got a call about a federal witness being transferred.,10
SCULLY,"That's Sergeant Louis Frish, he was the intended target. There was supposed to be a federal marshall here to put the sergeant into protective custody.",25
SKINNER,That order was countermanded.,4
SCULLY,By whom?,2
SKINNER,Louis Frish is being put under military arrest.,8
SCULLY,Military arrest?,2
SKINNER,Suspicion of murder and providing false testimony in a federal investigation.,11
SCULLY,He has testimony that is damaging to the military. His life is in danger. He is not going anywhere.,19
SKINNER,The order to arrest this man came out of the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff... who've also issued a recommendation on Agent Mulder.,25
SCULLY,For what?,2
SKINNER,Agent Mulder's also been put under military arrest on charges of interference with a military investigation into the crash of a commercial airliner.,23
SCULLY,"Sir, the military is responsible for the downing of that plane.",11
SKINNER,They are admitting as much... but Sergeant Frish's story is not the one they're telling.,15
SCULLY,What is their story?,4
SKINNER,"I have a responsibility for the safety of the agents under my supervision, Agent Scully. I'm not going to put another agent's life in jeopardy just to keep her on the field.",32
SCULLY,I'm fine.,2
SKINNER,I suggest you make sure of that when you go to the hospital with Agent Pendrell.,16
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully. You come to spring me from the joint?",10
SCULLY,I came to talk to you.,6
MULDER,About what? The big old misunderstanding?,6
SCULLY,"According to the military, there was no misunderstanding.",8
MULDER,"So all of a sudden, they just decide to take responsibility for the crash of Flight five-forty-nine?",17
SCULLY,"They had no choice, not in light of all the facts that have come out.",15
MULDER,"The facts? Have you heard their cover story? That the control tower gave bad coordinates to a fighter pilot, causing him to collide with Flight five-forty-nine over military airspace?",29
SCULLY,"They allowed me to listen to their recordings. If you believe them, the coordinates that Sergeant Frish gave to the fighter pilot were the exact path that five-four-nine was on. Now, they would indicate that Sergeant Frish and his co-controller could not have seen Flight five-four-nine in the airspace until it was too late.",54
MULDER,So they're saying the tower put those jets on a collision course.,12
SCULLY,"Yes, and that they were the only two aircraft on the radar screen.",13
MULDER,"And realizing his guilt, Sergeant Frish's fellow officer put a gun to his head.",14
SCULLY,"According to the Air Force, Sergeant Frish lied to save himself. When he found out that his, his fellow officer committed suicide, he came to us to blame the military. That's why they pursued him, to bring him to justice.",40
MULDER,Then they could conveniently lay the blame on a dead man.,11
SCULLY,Yes.,1
MULDER,"This, uh... second plane... they say it's a military fighter?",10
SCULLY,"It was an F-Fifteen Eagle, according to an Air Force spokesman.",11
MULDER,"You believe that story, Scully?",5
SCULLY,I don't know what to believe.,6
MULDER,You believe I got this from an F-Fifteen Eagle?,9
SCULLY,Those look like radiation burns. Where did you get that?,10
MULDER,"At the second crash site, in about fifty feet of water at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake.",17
SCULLY,You found it?,3
MULDER,"Mm-hmm. I followed a trail of bubbles down to the wreckage, but it didn't look like anything that might take off from an Air Force base.",26
SCULLY,What was it?,3
MULDER,"What collided with Flight five-forty-nine was a UFO shot down by the military, taking the passenger plane right along with it.",21
SCULLY,Except it can't be proven.,5
MULDER,Why not?,2
SCULLY,Because they haven't been able to find any physical evidence whatsoever that Flight five-forty-nine was involved in a collision.,19
MULDER,According to who?,3
SCULLY,"Mike Millar, the I.I.C.... the man running the investigation.",9
MULDER,How do you know he's not lying?,7
SCULLY,"I don't, except he seems to be the one man that truly wants to figure out what downed that plane and who came to me with information he had no reason to share.",33
MULDER,What information?,2
SCULLY,"He found Sharon Graffia wandering in a daze at the crash site the night we left, after seeing lights over the area.",22
MULDER,Max Fenig's sister?,3
SCULLY,"That's another thing, Mulder. She's not Max Fenig's sister.",9
MULDER,"Well, who is she?",4
SCULLY,She's an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spent time in-and-out of mental institutions. That's where she met Max.,17
MULDER,Why would she lie?,4
SCULLY,"I don't know. All I know is that this plane seems to be killing people as it sits there on the ground. Mulder, Agent Pendrell is dead.",27
MULDER,"H, how?",2
SCULLY,"Shot in an attempt on Sergeant Frish on Washington. He saved his life, Mulder, and maybe mine.",17
MULDER,"Wait, Scully, Scully.",3
SCULLY,What are these people dying for? Is it for the truth or for the lies?,15
MULDER,"It's got to be for the truth. If we owe them anything, it's to make sure of that.",18
MULDER,"Excuse me, sir, Max Fenig?",5
GARDENER,Over there.,2
MULDER,Thanks. Remember this place?,4
SCULLY,I remember being amazed at what some people will call home.,11
MULDER,"You have to admit, the man had an enduring sense of style.",12
SCULLY,"Only Max Fenig and you would appreciate living like this. I think you were actually kindred spirits in some deep, strange way.",22
MULDER,What do you mean?,4
SCULLY,"Men with Spartan lives, simple in their creature comforts if only to allow for the complexity of their passions.",19
MULDER,"Hmmm, beans and weinies.",4
SCULLY,"What exactly are we looking for here, Mulder?",8
MULDER,Something to explain what Max was doing on that plane... what he was coming to show me or tell me.,20
SCULLY,What makes you think he was coming to see you?,10
MULDER,"Max is the key to all this. He knew that plane was in danger even before it took off, before it entered military airspace. How would he know that? And what would be worth taking that risk?",37
MAX FENIG,"Hi. Max here. But of course. This is, uh, well, quite obviously, uh, my story, since I'm telling it. Anyway... um... for those of you who know me already, this is going to be ancient history, but for the rest of you, this is... well, what can I say... the story of my life. Actually, all I ever wanted in life was to be left alone. Don't we all? So just my luck that I'd eventually become an alien abductee. Now I'm never alone. Any minute, when I'm least expecting it... And the worst part is, no one believes you. Well, uh... almost no one. So, I've devoted my life to providing all you disbelievers out there with proof. Proof that there are extraterrestrial biological entities right now, as we speak, visiting our planet in alien ships for purposes of a rather troubling agenda known only to certain members of the government, uh, the F.B.I. and certain high-ranking members...",159
MAN,Hey!,1
SCOTT GARRETT,We found it.,3
MIKE MILLAR,"Recovery and identification of the deceased victims of Flight five-four-nine is at seventy-six percent... which is far better than anticipated, given the kind of destruction we've all seen. We've got a total of nearly three-thousand man-hours logged already in this first wave of investigation... and I wish I could tell you folks that we've come up with something more concrete, but... the evidence... just doesn't support anything more conclusive than the Air Force's assertion that the cause of this crash was a midair collision... or a catastrophic near-miss. I'm going to ask you all to wrap-up your reports tonight... and then I want you to go home to your families. You've done a good and thorough job here. You'll be in touch with me or someone from the N.T.S.B. on anything further. I just wanted to thank you all personally. Thank you. I'd wondered what happened to you. I'd put in a call.",153
MULDER,You had something you wanted to tell us?,8
MIKE MILLAR,"No. Just, just... just wanted to touch base. Thank you for your help in leading us to the fact of the military's involvement.",23
MULDER,"I think the facts are still a matter of speculation, Mister Millar, and listening to what you just said, I think you do, too.",24
SCULLY,The military's public claim of fault for the collision and their covert actions to promote that claim have raised some suspicions.,21
MIKE MILLAR,Suspicions? Of what?,3
SCULLY,That the story the military is now promoting is a convenient deflection and cover-up.,14
MIKE MILLAR,Of what?,2
MULDER,"Agent Scully and I agree on some of the motives, but not exactly on the facts.",16
MIKE MILLAR,Do you have facts that I don't?,7
MULDER,"No, but I do have a story if you're willing to hear it. Feel free to tell me it's bull, as Agent Scully has......but I think it's as believable as any story I've heard floated, but at least it's the only one that can't be refuted by the facts.",49
MIKE MILLAR,All right.,2
MULDER,"There was one man who knew what brought this plane down, and he knew it even before he got on the plane, but he got on anyway. He sat right here in this seat, thirteen-F. His name was Max Fenig. There are a number of possibilities for Max's suspicions, but I believe Max had been followed for some time before he boarded Flight five-forty-nine. And I believe he was followed onto this plane by someone who wanted whatever it is Max had carried onboard with him. The object that ultimately brought down this plane, the cause which has eluded you.",100
MIKE MILLAR,And what was this object?,5
MULDER,"Physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. The person who followed Max on the plane may have been prepared to kill to obtain this object, it's value greater than one human life, greater than the lives of the hundred-and-thirty-four people on that plane. Whether that plan was executed, we may never know because Flight five-forty-nine was intercepted by a second aircraft, an aircraft which did not appear on the military's or anyone else's radar screen.",78
PILOT,What the hell is this?,5
MULDER,"Max Fenig knew immediately what this craft was and that he would not be completing the rest of the flight as scheduled. Max would have recognized immediately all the signs of a classic abduction scenario... The craft taking control of the plane and all it's systems... Preparing to take Max. But something happened. Something went terribly wrong, something unimaginable.",59
MIKE MILLAR,Okay.,1
MULDER,"A third aircraft, probably an F-Fifteen Eagle, was given the coordinates to Flight five-forty-nine.",14
LOUIS FRISH,Heading one-zero-zero at two-niner thousand feet.,6
MULDER,"The flight controllers watched the fighter enter Flight five-forty-nine's airspace on an intercept pattern... Not knowing what they had set in motion, no way of knowing there was a third craft which was not on their screen. Not knowing that for the next nine minutes, time would stand still on Flight five-forty-nine.",52
PILOT,"We got something... some intercept. Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!",13
MIKE MILLAR,"You're saying the man sitting in seat thirteen-F was abducted mid-flight without any depressurization of the cabin, without any effect on the plane.",23
MULDER,"If not for factors unforeseen, I believe Max Fenig would have been abducted and returned to Flight five-forty-nine without any loss of life, without a trace.",26
MIKE MILLAR,Then what happened?,3
MULDER,"Flight five-forty-nine and the alien craft which has taken control of it were intercept by the military fighter which had been given a specific set of orders... take down the UFO. The missing nine minutes aboard Flight five-forty-nine, the nine minutes which would have been erased from the memories of the hundred-and-thirty-four passengers on board, would prove to be the final minutes of their lives.",65
WOMAN,"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death! Amen!",32
MIKE MILLAR,"You're saying that, that Flight five-four-nine was in the grip of... sort of a UFO tractor beam?",17
MULDER,"That's the Hollywood term, but yes.",6
MIKE MILLAR,"And the Air Force shot down the UFO, thereby sending five-four-nine out of control when the beam went off.",19
MULDER,Yes.,1
MIKE MILLAR,"Well, where I come from, that's what we call a ""whopper."" Even if it were true, I could never in a million years sell that to Washington, and neither could you.",31
MULDER,Not without the object that Max Fenig was carrying.,9
SCULLY,"Look, I, I had the same reaction to the story as you, but there is one logical area that has yet to be explained and that is that the, the seats and the door did show traces of, of radioactivity. Now, now you found nothing in the wreckage? No source of any emitter?",53
MIKE MILLAR,"I did find something. I think you should look at. After you'd found the first traces, I had my team see if they could link the radioactivity to a cause. They found no other evidence... Except for this.",38
MULDER,That's it?,2
MIKE MILLAR,That's all there was. I'm going to have to make my final report. I'll include this if it makes any difference to you.,23
SCULLY,But not as a causal factor.,6
MIKE MILLAR,It's a good story. Maybe you can sell it to the movies.,12
SCULLY,"Mulder, I don't know what else you expect him to do.",11
MULDER,"Yeah, I know.",3
SCULLY,"Look, it is a good story, but it's, it's a house of cards built on a shaky foundation. We may never know what Max was carrying.",26
MULDER,"And we may never know who killed Agent Pendrell. And if we don't find out, what meaning did their deaths have? Or their lives? I mean, Max'll be remembered as a... Disappointing rummage sale or some kook on a home video.",41
SCULLY,"Well, where do we even start?",6
MULDER,How about Sharon Graffia?,4
SCULLY,"She's a disturbed person, Mulder. She wasn't even who she claimed to be.",13
MULDER,"Yeah, but she knew Max well enough for him to write her thousands of letters, well enough for him to call her and tell her he was going to die. Do you know where she is?",36
SCULLY,In a mental institution.,4
MULDER,"I'd, I'd go with you, but I'm, I'm afraid they'd lock me up.",13
SCULLY,Me too.,2
LANDLORD,Hello. Are you a friend of Max's?,7
MULDER,"No. My name is, uh, Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.",10
LANDLORD,"You're kidding, right?",3
MULDER,"No, why?",2
LANDLORD,"Well, I manage the park. I know Max had some weird friends and I don't believe the F.B.I. sends men out cause somebody trashed a trailer.",26
MULDER,Any idea who did this?,5
LANDLORD,"N, no. Is Max in trouble or something?",8
MULDER,"No, Max is dead. He, he died in a plane crash a few days ago.",15
LANDLORD,"Oh, Lord, I... I am sorry to hear that.",9
MULDER,"Uh, did, did he ever mention why he would leave or where he would go?",15
LANDLORD,No. But he disappeared sometimes. Had... stories. You're sure that's not what happened to him?,15
MULDER,"Yeah, I'm... yeah, I'm sure.",5
LANDLORD,"Have you, uh, any idea who's going to be taking care of his estate? Where I should, uh, forward his mail?",21
MULDER,"Oh, he has mail?",4
LANDLORD,"Yeah, a small stack of it. I'll run and get it if you want.",14
MULDER,Please.,1
LANDLORD,Here you go. Sure feel sorry about Max.,8
MULDER,So do I.,3
SCULLY,Sharon?,1
SHARON GRAFFIA,Hello.,1
SCULLY,How are you feeling? Are you up to answering some questions?,11
SHARON GRAFFIA,I'm not Max's sister.,4
SCULLY,"I know. I'm not quite sure why you lied to us, though, Sharon... or what else you might be lying about.",21
SHARON GRAFFIA,It doesn't matter anymore.,4
SCULLY,"Yes, it does. If you know something, if you know anything about what Max was doing, about what he was carrying on that plane... it could matter a lot.",29
SHARON GRAFFIA,To who?,2
SCULLY,To Max.,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,I can't.,2
SCULLY,Why not?,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,"Because I could be in big, big trouble.",8
SCULLY,"Max had those same blisters. You both were exposed to something, Sharon. What was it?",15
SHARON GRAFFIA,It was something I stole.,5
SCULLY,"From whom? Max was trying to find physical evidence to prove that the stories about his abductions were true. You worked as an aeronautical systems engineer. You stole something from your employer, didn't you, Sharon? Something radioactive.",37
SHARON GRAFFIA,Only because I believed in Max.,6
SCULLY,What was it?,3
SHARON GRAFFIA,Max said it was alien technology. It was three interlocking parts. We divided it into sections. I had one part. Max had another onboard that flight... But they were taken from us.,32
SCULLY,There was a third part. What happened to it?,9
MULDER,I left a bag here.,5
CLERK,"Big bag, little bag?",4
MULDER,"Short bag, tall bag. I, I don't remember. Little bag, I think.",12
MAN,He's at the baggage claim.,5
CLERK,Is this it?,3
MULDER,I'm a federal officer. I need a security entrance to the terminal.,12
CLERK,Right this way.,3
MULDER,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me. Where are you?",6
MULDER,"I'm at the airport in Syracuse, New York. Whatever is it that Max had, I have it now.",18
SCULLY,How did you find it?,5
MULDER,Luck.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder... What you're carrying was stolen from a military contractor, Cummins Aerospace.",12
MULDER,"Well, what is it?",4
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MULDER,"Well, I'm going to let you know in a minute.",10
SCULLY,Mulder... It is extremely important that you do not take it out of its container.,15
MULDER,What's that? I'm having trouble hearing you on the phone here.,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, did you hear what I said?",7
MULDER,"No, hold on a second, I'm going to tell you what it looks like.",14
SCULLY,"No, no, no, Mulder, listen to me. Do not handle it. Whatever it is... It is highly radioactive.",18
MULDER,Hold on a second.,4
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,"It looks like a small superstructure with three circular pieces inside. It's hard to tell on an x-ray, hold on.",20
SCULLY,"I think that what we've got here, Mulder, is a case of high-tech industrial espionage.",15
MULDER,"More people are trying to get their hands on this thing than a ""Tickle-Me Elmo"" doll. I'm getting on a flight.",21
SCULLY,What flight number?,3
MULDER,I think it's five-oh-one. Yeah. I'm going to need a ride when I get there.,15
SCULLY,"I don't think that'll to be a problem, Mulder.",9
MULDER,Thanks. Can I give you this?,6
STEWARDESS,Certainly.,1
MULDER,Thanks.,1
SCOTT GARRETT,Excuse me. You look like you have some room here. Do you mind?,13
MULDER,"No, go ahead.",3
SCOTT GARRETT,Didn't mean to disturb you.,5
MULDER,It's all right.,3
SCOTT GARRETT,You traveling by yourself? You live in D.C.?,8
MULDER,"There's a weapon pointed at you right now. If I shoot you at this range, it wouldn't just hit you in the leg. If you so much as raise your arms off that armrest, I'm going to test that theory.",40
SCOTT GARRETT,What if you miss?,4
MULDER,I won't.,2
SCOTT GARRETT,"Do you know what happens when a plane suddenly depressurizes at thirty-thousand feet, Mister Mulder? After the cabin fills with fog and all light objects, anything not tied down......and including your weapon, go flying toward the breach?",37
MULDER,A pretty lady comes around with honey-roasted peanuts?,8
SCOTT GARRETT,"Presuming the pilot... is even able to keep control of the plane, I put on the lightweight parachute I just stowed in the overhead bin and go out the emergency exit... with the knapsack you're holding.",36
MULDER,What if the pilot can't get control of the plane? Then you die too.,14
SCOTT GARRETT,"A man, if he's any man at all, knows he must be ready to sacrifice himself to that which is greater than he.",23
MULDER,I'm sure all the other passengers on this plane would appreciate dying for your noble philosophy.,16
SCOTT GARRETT,"Look out your window, Agent Mulder. You see the lights? Now, imagine if one of those lights flickered off. You'd hardly notice, would you? A dozen... two dozen lights extinguished. Is it worth sacrificing the future, the lives of millions, to keep a few lights on?",46
MULDER,What is this?,3
SCOTT GARRETT,Stolen property.,2
MULDER,"It's an alien energy source, isn't it? What is it, cold fusion? Over-unity energy? What could be worth killing all those passengers on Flight five-forty-nine?",25
SCOTT GARRETT,The cause of that crash has been determined as human error.,11
MULDER,I'm going to see you pay for that error... along with you and your employer and the government that finances its contracts. I want you to stand up very slowly and move to the back of the plane. We're going to go to the bathroom. Move.,46
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully, it's me.",4
SCULLY,"Mulder, where are you?",4
MULDER,I'm standing outside an airplane bathroom where I've got the man who shot Pendrell locked up.,16
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,"Yeah, and it looks like I'm going to miss the in-flight movie. Something starring Steve Guttenberg.",16
SCULLY,"Mulder, did you get on that flight......that you said you were getting on?",13
MULDER,"Uh, yeah. Everything's going according to plan, but I think you should alert Skinner anyway, just in case. I don't want to take any chances of getting this guy off the plane. And I don't think you do either.",39
SCULLY,Right.,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully.",2
SCULLY,Yeah?,1
MULDER,My watch just stopped.,4
SCULLY,What? Mulder? Mulder?,3
MULDER,Excuse me. I'm a federal agent. I want you to listen to me very carefully. This plane is about to be intercepted.,22
STEWARDESS,Intercepted.,1
MULDER,"Intercepted, engaged and boarded. I want you to tell the captain to initiate evasive maneuvers immediately.",16
SCOTT GARRETT,Put the bag down! Put it down on the floor.,10
MULDER,Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Drop it! Hey! Let it go! Let it go!,15
SCULLY,Mulder. Where is he?,4
MULDER,He's not here.,3
SCULLY,"What do you mean? You said you had him on this plane. You said you had what Max Fenig had, the stolen part. Skinner walks over and Mulder looks up at him.)",32
MULDER,What time do you have?,5
SKINNER,"Ten fifty-six. realizing what has happened. He shows the watch to Scully.) Would you like to tell me what's going on here, Agent Mulder?",24
SCULLY,I don't think you want to know the answer.,9
SKINNER,Is this man on the plane?,6
MULDER,I think he got the connecting flight.,7
MAX FENIG,"But... but nobody ever finds out about it. I mean, there...",11
SHARON GRAFFIA,"These tapes, you don't mind if I keep them?",9
MULDER,"No, I think you, you should consider yourself the sole curator of the Max Fenig Rolling Multimedia Library and Archive, and you should probably get tax-exempt status as soon as you can. This stuff could be worth something someday.",39
SHARON GRAFFIA,"I want to thank you for helping me out, for all you've done.",13
SCULLY,Max would have wanted it that way. You lost somebody very close to you.,14
SHARON GRAFFIA,So did you.,3
MULDER,You thinking about Pendrell?,4
SCULLY,I realized I didn't even know his first name.,9
SCULLY,"I actually was thinking about, uh... This gift that you gave me for my birthday. You never got to tell me why you gave it to me or what it means... but I think I know. I think that you appreciate that there are extraordinary men and women and... extraordinary moments when history leaps forward on the backs of these individuals... that what can be imagined can be achieved... that you must dare to dream... but that there's no substitute for perseverance and hard work... and teamwork... because no one gets there alone... and that, while we commemorate the... the greatness of these events and the individuals who achieve them, we cannot forget the sacrifice of those who make these achievements and leaps possible.",124
MULDER,I just thought it was a pretty cool keychain.,9
