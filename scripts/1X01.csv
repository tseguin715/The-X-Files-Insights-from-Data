COMMANDING OFFICER,"As soon as we're in position, we'll be on a count of five.",13
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Excuse me, that's my house.",5
MILITARY POLICE OFFICER,"Ok, let her through.",4
ANITA BUDAHAS,What's going on?,3
COMMANDING OFFICER,Standby. Mrs. Budahas?,3
ANITA BUDAHAS,Yeah.,1
COMMANDING OFFICER,Your husband has violated basic security procedure. He's commandeered a military vehicle that's believed to be armed.,17
LEAD OFFICER,Keep on moving in.,4
ANITA BUDAHAS,Oh God!,2
VOICE,We have access..,3
ANITA BUDAHAS,You've got to let me talk to him.,8
LEAD OFFICER,What the hell. We got him but he's gonna need a doctor.. or something.,14
SCULLY,Hi. I got your message.,5
MULDER,Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?,11
SCULLY,It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.,7
MULDER,It's not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.,14
SCULLY,Something you couldn't show me at work.,7
MULDER,"Let's get a table. That's Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.",62
SCULLY,"Which was what, exactly?",4
MULDER,"The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.",23
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,"Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.",34
SCULLY,What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?,13
MULDER,"That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.",37
SCULLY,"Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.",20
MULDER,"There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can't figure out, it was deprioritised. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.",39
SCULLY,So?,1
MULDER,"So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.",15
SCULLY,"I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?",29
MULDER,"Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me.",17
DEEP THROAT,Leave this case alone Agent Mulder.,6
MULDER,What?,1
DEEP THROAT,The military will not tolerate an FBI investigation.,8
MULDER,Who are you?,3
DEEP THROAT,"I, er, can be of help to you. I've had a certain interest in your work.",16
VOICE,Sorry.,1
MULDER,How do you know about my work?,7
DEEP THROAT,"Well, let's just say that I'm in a position to know quite alot of things, er, things about our government.",20
MULDER,Who are you? Who do you work for?,8
DEEP THROAT,"It's unimportant, I came here to give you some valuable advice. You are exposing yourself and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk, I advise you to drop the case.",28
MULDER,I can't do that.,4
DEEP THROAT,"You have much work to do Agent Mulder, don't jeopardise the future of your own efforts.",16
SCULLY,You ok Mulder?,3
MULDER,"Yeah, I'm fine.",3
MULDER,Hello.,1
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,I checked on that file you gave me.,8
MULDER,Uh-huh.,1
SCULLY,"You failed to tell me a few things. This isn't some UFO goose chase, you're leading me on, is it? Are you there Mulder?",24
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.",32
MULDER,"Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. I'll, I'll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK?",24
ANITA BUDAHAS,Hello?,1
MULDER,Mrs. Budahas?,2
ANITA BUDAHAS,Yes.,1
MULDER,We're from the FBI.,4
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Oh, yes, please, come in. I started noticing it about two years ago, m, Bob developed this rash under his arms. We'd been doing some renovations on the house, so that, we thought it was a reaction to the paint stripper. But then everything just, went crazy.",47
SCULLY,How do you mean?,4
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Bob's whole personality, it was so unpredictable. He started, doing things.",11
MULDER,What kinds of things?,4
ANITA BUDAHAS,"It was kind of embarassing at first, we were having this dinner party once, and, erm, he sprinkled tetra-meal D all other his food. That's fishfood flakes.",27
SCULLY,Did you ever talk to him about this?,8
ANITA BUDAHAS,"I tried, i, it was extemely difficult, Bob would get so angry, he'd, yell at the kids for no reason, and, and then, and then he would shake, like he was having a, a seizure.",35
MULDER,Did he ever talk about his work?,7
ANITA BUDAHAS,"It was never discussed, e, even before the problems. Oh, I knew that he worked on top secret projects, word gets around, but, Bob was always a patriot first. He took, loyalty to his country as an oath, and, and now they treat us like strangers. I just want my husband back.",52
SCULLY,You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.,14
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Th, then I think, what if he's... How would I support the family?",13
MULDER,"Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?",19
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Erm, yeah. Verla McLennen's husband, he went kinda crazy, but it's, it's not like he didn't get to come home.",20
SCULLY,How long has he been...,5
VERLA MCLENNEN,"Almost two years, the flyfishing idea was his brother Hank's. I was upset at first, but when you're the wife of a test pilot, you thank God just to have him home alive.",33
MULDER,"Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?",11
VERLA MCLENNEN,"Stress, I guess. You have to understand, the military deals with things in a certain way. They've given him plenty of therapy, and treatment, and I'm grateful for that. They've taken good care of us. And you know they do volunteer for their jobs. Really Anita, bringing the FBI to my house.",52
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Here, I've, erm, I've called all the numbers about a thousand times, please, let me know what you find out.",20
SCULLY,"We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?",12
ANITA BUDAHAS,Thanks. C'mon kids.,3
MULDER,So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?,11
SCULLY,"Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they've studied it in zoo animals.",25
MULDER,"Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. They're not supposed to fold under pressure, they're supposed to thrive on it.",23
SCULLY,Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project?,8
MULDER,"Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defence department, surveillance project.",15
SCULLY,"The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.",33
MULDER,"You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commodation, he's never washed out of anything in his life.",25
MULDER,"I've been on hold with the base director of communications for fourty-five minutes, how about you?",16
SCULLY,"Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.",13
MULDER,"Yeah, right. Did you say Kissel?",6
MULDER,Colonel Kissel?,2
COLONEL KISSEL,Yes.,1
MULDER,"Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.",9
COLONEL KISSEL,"I've got nothing to say. Please, this is an invasion of my privacy.",13
MULDER,Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?,9
COLONEL KISSEL,Why don't you get the hell out of my yard.,10
SCULLY,Good thing we still kept that appointment.,7
PAUL MOSSINGER,"Hi. Are you the FBI agents? I'm Paul Mossinger, I, er, work for the local paper. We live a few houses down from Verla McLennen, she said you guys are out here looking into this Budahas thing.",37
MULDER,We're just looking around.,4
PAUL MOSSINGER,"Aah, gotcha, right. Lot of people around here just looking around, UFO nuts mostly, but it's not everyday we get FBI. By the time you hear them, they're already gone. So this Budahas thing, are you getting anywhere?",38
MULDER,We're not at liberty to comment.,6
PAUL MOSSINGER,Well...,1
MULDER,"Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?",14
PAUL MOSSINGER,"Never, bunch of hoo-ey if you ask me. People see what they wanna see.",14
MULDER,"But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you refered to earlier, where would I go?",19
ZOE,"F-15 Eagle pulling about four g's. Those boys think they are such hotshots. Get a few drinks in `em, you'd think it was them up there flapping their wings.",29
MULDER,Who's the photographer?,3
ZOE,Various and sundry. I took the one on the end there.,11
MULDER,"You're kidding, where?",3
ZOE,"Out on the back porch, taking out the garbage, and there it was, just hovering. Quiet like a hummingbird. For a minute there, I thought it was gonna land in the parking lot and I was gonna have to serve `em lunch. I'm selling limited edition prints, twenty dollars. Down to my last five, if you're interested.",57
MULDER,Put it on my tab.,5
SCULLY,Sucker.,1
MULDER,"What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?",12
SCULLY,Catch ye outside.,3
SCULLY,"Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn't even on my US GS quadrant map.",16
MULDER,I know. Let's go.,4
SCULLY,You know. Where are we going?,6
MULDER,"We got our own map, sucker.",6
WARNING,THIS AREA IS A RESTRICTED MILITARY INSTALLATION TO THE WEST. At the top of the sign is a symbol indicating no cameras. Mulder stops the car further up the road beside a fence. He gets out goes to the boot and gets a pair of binoculars),46
SCULLY,What do you honestly hope to see?,7
MULDER,"I don't know, maybe nothing.",5
SCULLY,"Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for UFOs. Yea, this is gonna look real good on my field report.",23
SCULLY,Aaaaaah!,1
MULDER,"Scully, wake up. You've gotta see this.",7
SCULLY,Unnh!,1
SCULLY,What are they?,3
MULDER,"I don't know, just keep watching it's unbelievable.",8
SCULLY,That's unreal. I've never seen anything like it.,8
MULDER,They've been going at it like that for almost half an hour.,12
SCULLY,"Well, it can't be aircraft. Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.",10
MULDER,What else could they be?,5
SCULLY,"I don't know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds. Oh my God.",18
MULDER,Here comes another one.,4
SCULLY,"That's not a plane, that's a helicopter.",7
MULDER,Hey.,1
EMIL,"Let's get outta here. Ok, don't shoot.",7
MULDER,Stay right there.,3
LADONNA,We didn't do anything.,4
MULDER,Come on.,2
EMIL,"Heh, heh, That was extreme.",5
MULDER,"Let's go, you're coming with us.",6
EMIL,What?,1
SCULLY,"So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?",9
EMIL,"We were, erm, we're...",4
LADONNA,We kinda have this spot.,5
EMIL,"You know, we go, we kinda, kick back and listen to some tunes and, er, watch the air show.",19
MULDER,Were you ever chased out before?,6
EMIL,"No, first time right. Our friend showed us a hole in the fence about a year ago.",17
LADONNA,"Oh, one time they dropped these bombs, wooah!",8
EMIL,"Yeah, it was kinda heavy. Oh, ar, there's this place, ar, called the Yellow Base, right, where they're supposed to store all this stuff. And my friend said that, there's landmines all around it and junk like that.",38
PAUL MOSSINGER,"I've got a twenty, over.",5
WALKIE-TALKIE,"Roger, Redbird, assume fall back position, we're opening the gate.",10
PAUL MOSSINGER,Redbird out.,2
EMIL,"Sometimes they come in real low, and just put on the scares right, it's like eeoou-ra and then they just hang there, and hover without making a sound. And you just think, you know, who turned down the volume right.",40
MULDER,What do you think they are?,6
EMIL,"Ok, everybody thinks that they're like UFOs, but I think it's some kinda, star wars cyber- tech new fangled hardware right, they probably roll it out for, desert storm II or something like that. Cruise right over Saddam's house, you know, it'll be like, what.",45
MULDER,Do they look anything like this?,6
EMIL,"No, they look exactly like that.",6
EMIL,Thanks.,1
MULDER,Later Dude!,2
SCULLY,What's that?,2
MULDER,"Evidence. Kids today, huh.",4
SCULLY,"You believe it all, don't you?",6
MULDER,Why wouldn't I?,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...",12
MULDER,"Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.",7
SCULLY,"Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that's exactly what he saw.",24
MULDER,"Alright, I wanna show you something. This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don't believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.",76
SCULLY,"Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.",10
MULDER,"No, planes built, using UFO technology.",6
SCULLY,"Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You're going out on a pretty big limb.",33
MULDER,"Tell me, there isn't a remarkable resemblance.",7
SCULLY,"Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.",12
MULDER,You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?,16
SCULLY,"Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna believe they were UFOs.",14
MULDER,"Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I'm crazy.",15
SCULLY,"Mulder, you're crazy. And it still doesn't explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas.",15
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
WOMAN,You're welcome.,2
MULDER,"You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?",9
SCULLY,You ready for this.,4
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night.",13
SCULLY,We got your message.,4
MULDER,"Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?",5
ANITA BUDAHAS,"C,come inside.",2
SCULLY,What is it?,3
MULDER,What? What's wrong?,3
ANITA BUDAHAS,"That, is not my husband.",5
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,"Honey, who are these people?",5
ANITA BUDAHAS,That is not him. That is not my husband. They've done something to him.,14
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,"It's ok, it's ok, just relax, wel, I'm Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We're out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.",36
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,I was in the hospital.,5
MULDER,"Here, on base?",3
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,I think so.,3
MULDER,"Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?",11
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,"November 21st, 1948.",3
MULDER,And the names of your kids?,6
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,"Josh and Lesley, they're right there.",6
ANITA BUDAHAS,Yeah.,1
MULDER,Green Bay fan.,3
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,Yes sir.,2
MULDER,"Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.",10
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,"Kicked four field goals, Lombardy's last game. Why do I have to answer these questions?",15
ANITA BUDAHAS,It's not him.,3
MULDER,"Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that right?",10
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,Yes sir.,2
MULDER,"Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g's, huh, is that possible?",31
LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,"I, I don't... I can't... Anita, I can't remember.",9
ANITA BUDAHAS,No.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on.",9
MULDER,I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.,13
SCULLY,"The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't just go in and erase certain files.",16
MULDER,Then you explain it to me.,6
SCULLY,There are types of amnesia th..,6
MULDER,"This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate and insidious.",13
SCULLY,"All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.",19
MULDER,"And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn't in his head anymore.",39
SCULLY,"Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?",11
MULDER,"To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.",16
SCULLY,It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?,15
MULDER,"No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those manoeuvres, at those speeds. I mean we're talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it's taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.",55
SCULLY,What the hell is th..,5
MULDER,Hold on.,2
MAN,"Please, step out of the car.",6
MULDER,"You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away?",10
MAN,"Please, step out of the car.",6
MULDER,"Guess not. Special Agent Mulder, FBI.",6
SCULLY,Federal Agents.,2
MULDER,You wanna tell me what this is about.,8
MAN,"National security. Now get in your car. You'll be escorted back to your motel. You will pack and leave town immediately, or assume the consequences of intense indiscretion.",28
SCULLY,"Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no no no, I'm sure the other one's bogus too, bye. So who were those guys?",29
MULDER,"I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.",45
SCULLY,Something else.,2
MULDER,"I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn't give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.",29
SCULLY,What!,1
MULDER,"Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there's a huge conspiracy here Scully. They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it. And they'll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.",58
SCULLY,"If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.",11
MULDER,"No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.",22
SCULLY,"Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn't the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it's secrets?",36
MULDER,"Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?",20
SCULLY,"Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let's get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job.",28
MULDER,"Aren't you even curious? Aaerm, I gonna shower, I'll pack and then, we'll get outta here.",16
SCULLY,"Mulder, where are you going?",5
EMIL,Right here.,2
MULDER,"Hey, aren't you guys coming?",5
EMIL,"No, we're, you know, we've only gone in at night.",10
MULDER,"Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?",17
EMIL,Fourty-five minutes.,2
MULDER,Will I be able to find it?,7
LADONNA,Just stay on the path.,5
MULDER,"And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.",16
EMIL,"Don't, don't even, it's like ten miles, nobody's ever, nobody's ever been that far.",14
LADONNA,"Hey, don't go past the edge of the tall weeds.",10
EMIL,"Oh man, did we tell him about the, landmines and junk? HEY!",12
VOICE,"Go, go.",2
MULDER,Nooo.,1
VOICE,C'mon. Hold `im. Oxygen.,4
SCULLY,"Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can't seem to get a long distance line. Hello? Hello? Excuse me. Erm, my phone's not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?",42
MOTEL MANAGER,Sure thing.,2
SCULLY,This one's not working either.,5
MOTEL MANAGER,"Phones are pretty undependable around here. People say it's the military interference, but, they say that about everything.",18
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
PAUL MOSSINGER,"Hi, I was just looking for you. I knocked, but I saw the door was open.",16
SCULLY,I was in the lobby trying to make a call.,10
PAUL MOSSINGER,Phones down again.,3
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
WALKIE-TALKIE,"Base to redbird, can you give us your position, over? Redbird do you copy?",14
PAUL MOSSINGER,What are you doing? Excuse me. There's nothing in there. smashes the passenger's window with a fire extinguisher and Scully drops the gun while covering herself from the glass. Paul reaches in for Scully but she manages to push her thumb in his eye. He then goes around to the driver's door but Scully gets out and holds the gun to his face),63
SCULLY,"Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it.",10
PAUL MOSSINGER,"Put the gun down, and we'll talk about it.",9
SCULLY,"I said, hands against the car. Who are you?",9
PAUL MOSSINGER,"You're a long way from home, Dr. Scully. Nobody wants this to come to violence now.",16
SCULLY,Where's Mulder?,2
EMIL,We took `im to the base.,6
LADONNA,We waited for `im.,4
SCULLY,I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is.,14
PAUL MOSSINGER,I don't think I can do that.,7
SCULLY,"I think you can, or I'm gonna have every newspaper in America out here, writing about your experimental aircraft.",19
PAUL MOSSINGER,There are other ways to go about this.,8
SCULLY,"Yeah, I've already seen where you get with tears and a sad story.",13
WALKIE-TALKIE,Your target is arriving 12.,5
GUARD,Roger.,1
SCULLY,What are we doing?,4
PAUL MOSSINGER,Waiting.,1
SCULLY,"I want the car running. I said start the car. And put your hands on the wheel, where I can see them.",22
PAUL MOSSINGER,"You do anything stupid, and this situation could get big in a hurry.",13
SCULLY,"Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.",7
WALKIE-TALKIE,Intruder arriving.,2
GUARD,Copy.,1
SCULLY,"I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the car. Get in the car Mulder. Get in the car.",23
PAUL MOSSINGER,"I just wanna say, everything you've seen here is equal to the protection we give it. It's you who have acted inappropriately.",22
SCULLY,You ok Mulder?,3
MULDER,I think so. Scully I...,5
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,How did I get here?,5
MULDER,Hi.,1
ANITA BUDAHAS,Hello.,1
MULDER,We came by to see how your husband was doing.,10
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Oooh, he's fine, he's getting much better now.",8
MULDER,"Do you think, maybe, we could see him.",8
ANITA BUDAHAS,"Aaerm, wel, well he's resting now.",6
LT COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS,Who is it now?,4
ANITA BUDAHAS,Thank you for your concern.,5
MULDER,"They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..",15
SCULLY,"That's enough Mulder. We don't know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that's what I gonna write in my field report. Let's get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.",34
DEEP THROAT,"Your lives, may be in danger.",6
MULDER,Why?,1
DEEP THROAT,"Mmm, you've seen things that weren't to be seen. Care and discretion, are now imperative.",15
MULDER,I saw something I...,4
DEEP THROAT,"As I said, I can provide you with information, but only so long as it's in my best interest to do so.",22
MULDER,What is your interest?,4
DEEP THROAT,The truth.,2
MULDER,"I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.",23
DEEP THROAT,"A military UFO? Mr. Mulder, why are those like yourself, who believe in the existence of extra terrestrial life on this earth, not dissuaded by all the evidence to the contrary?",31
MULDER,"Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.",11
DEEP THROAT,Precisely.,1
MULDER,"They're here, aren't they?",4
DEEP THROAT,"Mr. Mulder, they've been here for a long long time.",10
