WILLIAM SCULLY,"If your idea of a good time is picking up dried pine needles, treat yourself.",15

"" Approximate One Month Supply Time May Vary Depending On Frequency of Use or Size of Area to be Covered"") There's an approximate one-month supply here... And all you'll spend for this entire package is just 39 dollars and 92 cents.",67
WOMAN ON TV,Mr. Johnson?,2
RON POPEIL ON TV,Yes?,1
WOMAN ON TV,I was kind of interested that Allen used a blond and I hadn't seen anyone use a blond.,18
SCULLY,Dad? I thought you guys left. Where's Mom? Hello. Hello?,10
MARGARET SCULLY,Dana?,1
SCULLY,Mom? What's the matter?,4
MARGARET SCULLY,"We, um... we lost your dad. He had a... a massive coronary... about an hour ago. He... he's gone.",19
GIRL,"I swear, Christmas Day... my whole family's opening presents and all and I'm just sitting there in my own little world, thinking ""I just wish Jim were here.""",28
BOY,"Hmmm, I know. Oh man, busted. Yes, sir?",8
HENRY,"Out of the vehicle, please.",5
BOY,"We're sorry, sir. We'll be on our way.",8
HENRY,"I said, out of the vehicle Keep your hands down. Let's see some ID.",14
BOY,"No, not till I see yours.",6
SCULLY,"Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading the Adult Video News.",16
MULDER,"I didn't think you'd be in today. How are you, Dana?",11
SCULLY,"""Dana."" I'm fine, thank you. What are you working on?",10
MULDER,"Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University. Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers, both 19. Last year, another couple was kidnapped to the day except that abduction occured at Duke University. One week later, they found both students' bodies dead.",42
SCULLY,"They were kept alive, tortured through that period.",8
MULDER,"No arrests were ever made. Police believed it to be a one-time offender but now it appears to be a serial incident. Anyway, if he holds true to form, we have five days to find those kids.",37
SCULLY,That's a grim deadline.,4
MULDER,"Well, here's another grim deadline. In one week, Luther Lee Boggs will take a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber.",21
SCULLY,How is he related?,4
MULDER,He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping. He described Hawley's bracelet down to the last detail. This is information that only family members could have known.,28
SCULLY,Or the kidnapper.,3
MULDER,Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison.,20
SCULLY,His talents?,2
MULDER,He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmission.,10
SCULLY,"Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?",8
MULDER,"Perhaps. Boggs has been there before... in the chamber. My profile helped send him there. He was actually strapped to the chair before recieving an executive stay. He claims that this experience activated in him the ability to channel spirits and demons. I believe in psychic ability, without a doubt, but not in this case. Not Boggs.",57
SCULLY,So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside. A scam to save his life?,18
MULDER,"At the age of six, Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project. When he was thirty, he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter of the Detroit - Green Bay game. Some killers are projects of society. Some act out past abuses. Boggs kills because he likes it.",59
SCULLY,And they've requested you speak with him?,7
MULDER,"Actually, he's requested to speak to me.",7
SCULLY,Why you?,2
MULDER,"He read my profile on him and he believes I'm the only one who truly understands what he is. Anyway, I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.",26
SCULLY,I'll go with you. The funeral's at noon.,8
MULDER,I think you should take some time.,7
SCULLY,I need to work.,4
MULDER,I'm sorry about your father. I'll see you later.,9
SCULLY,Okay.,1
SCULLY,"As a captain, he was entitled to burial at Arlington with full ceremony.",13
MARGARET SCULLY,This is exactly how he wanted it. Just the family. This song was playing when his ship returned from the Cuban Blockade. He marched right off up to me... and he proposed.,32
SCULLY,I know that you and Dad were... disappointed that I chose the path I'm on instead of medicine but I need to know... was he at all proud of me?,30
MARGARET SCULLY,He was your father.,4
BOGGS,The soul of Luther Boggs drowns in hell's sea of fire. We have him now.,15
MULDER,We? You mean the souls of your victims?,8
BOGGS,The dead. The living. All souls are connected.,8
MULDER,And you're the conduit?,4
BOGGS,"Uh... Dana... Fox... please understand that from here, we can return to the past. We can see the present. We can know the future.",24
MULDER,From here? Where exactly are you?,6
BOGGS,Mr. Boggs must be made redemptive for his transgressions.,9
MULDER,That's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do next week.,13
BOGGS,"No. Uh-uh. Let's deal. Boggs' life for the kids, you know what I'm saying?",14
MULDER,"First you've got to prove you're telling the truth. Don't get me wrong, Luther. I want to believe.",18
BOGGS,"Oh... ah... oh, God, no. Must stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Pain! I'm in... pain, terrible pain... Uh... the boy, uh, Jim... he's tied with twine. Uh, packing twine. Uh, he, he whip, he whips them with a, a coat hanger, a wire coat hanger. Oh. Dark place. Cold. Cellar. Warehouse, condemned. An angel... of stone. Waterfall. Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall. Not water. They're there. Oh, God. I got to go. I got to go. I, I got to go.",84
MULDER,I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt. It has nothing to do with the crime.,17
BOGGS,"Somewhere... beyond the sea... Somewhere... waiting for me... Did you get my message, Starbuck?",14
GUARD,"Alright, thanks a lot.",4
MULDER,"Scully, what's wrong? Did Boggs say something to you?",9
SCULLY,"No. It's my father. I'm sorry, I'm sorry...",8
MULDER,"It's alright. Why don't you go back to the motel? We've exposed Boggs as a fraud. Boggs is not what he claims to be. He may be orchestrating the kidnapping. Now he knows that we're on to him, he doesn't have a chance with this charade. I'm going to wait around a couple of hours and try to interrogate him. Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.",68
BOGGS,Somewhere... beyond the shore... we'll kiss just as before... happy we'll be... beyond the sea... And never again...,18
BOGGS,"Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall. An angel of stone.",11
MULDER,It's Mulder. I just heard that Liz Hawley's family made a positive ID on the charm you found at the warehouse. The police are searching that place inch-by-inch but they haven't been able to find anything yet. I expected to find you at the crime scene.,46
SCULLY,Did Boggs confess?,3
MULDER,"No, no, just five hours of Boggs' channeling. After three hours, I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested ""All Along the Watchtower."" You know the guy's been dead for twenty years and he still hasn't lost his edge.",44
SCULLY,I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse. I didn't notice any suspicious activities.,17
MULDER,Then how did you find it?,6
SCULLY,It was where Boggs said it would be.,8
MULDER,"Scully, I told you about Boggs...",6
SCULLY,I didn't go looking for it! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of...,17
MULDER,That doesn't matter! That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could have been setting you up! You could be dead right now! Why did you lie in your police report?,29
SCULLY,I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances.,11
MULDER,"What you're really saying is that you didn't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs! The bureau would expect something like that from ""Spooky"" Mulder, but not Dana Scully.",33
SCULLY,I thought that you'd be pleased that I opened myself to extreme possibilities.,13
MULDER,"Why now? After all we've seen, why Boggs? Does this have to do with your father? You said that he didn't approve of you becoming an FBI agent. Now, if being on the job now makes you feel guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy, I think you should back away because if it's clouding your judgement, you're putting yourself in danger.",60
SCULLY,I love this job.,4
MULDER,"You love your father. Dana... open yourself up to extreme possibilities only when they're the truth. That goes for Luther Boggs... and your father. As for Luther Boggs, he's the greatest of lies. I know he's working with someone on the outside and they planted that evidence. Now, we have to be very careful about planning our next move because he's five steps ahead. The one advantage we have is time.",71
MULDER,"Scully, look at this.",4
SCULLY,Incredible! They found them?,4
MULDER,That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.,8
SCULLY,"I don't understand, why didn't the police notify us?",9
MULDER,"They haven't been found, the article is bogus. The Carolinian made this one up just for us, only six people know about it. Later on today, Boggs gets his weekly phone priviliges. Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice to find out what happened. Phone privilige is in two hours.",48
SCULLY,Go.,1
MULDER,Turn off that phone. Turn it off.,7
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's you.",3
MULDER,Mulder.,1
BOGGS,How come you don't believe me? Agent Scully believes me.,10
MULDER,Agent Scully believes what we all believe. That you have the kids. Now where are they?,16
SCULLY,"Mulder... even if he is setting us up, we have to follow because in three days...",16
MULDER,Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.,8
SCULLY,"And then a day later, our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber. We have to deal.",25
BOGGS,The kidnapper is aroused by the prospect of becoming a killer.,11
MULDER,What's the name?,3
BOGGS,Can't see... male...,3
MULDER,Describe him.,2
BOGGS,"Small... thin... late twenties... skull... Human skull... Silver gray... his eyes, cold, very cold... Staring at Elizabeth... God, he's got the wire... No... please, no...",25
MULDER,Where is he?,3
BOGGS,He's over... over... by the window... Holding back... holding back his thoughts of killing us... waiting... there's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.,23
MULDER,Did you get that?,4
BOGGS,Mulder... Don't go near the white cross. We see you down... and your blood spills on the white cross.,19
ELIZABETH,"No, no, no, no, no more...",6
AGENT,Do you see anything?,4
2ND AGENT,Negative.,1
SCULLY,Sweep the docks!,3
MULDER,Federal agent!,2
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
AGENT,"Get in there, now!",4
SCULLY,We need an ambulance... officer down!,6
PARAMEDIC,What do we got?,4
DOCTOR,Through and through upper femur...,5
NURSE,Can't palpate a radial pulse...,5
DOCTOR,"Okay, I want a B.P. on this stat... get him on the gurney.",13
PARAMEDIC,"One, two, three...",3
NURSE,Blood pressure is 67 on palpatation.,6
DOCTOR,"Okay, tighten him and screen him for six, I want two liters of normal saline in him now and give him two units of o-neg after the typing. Let's transfer now.",31
ELIZABETH,No. No. No.,3
MAN,"Lucas Jackson Henry, 28. Did some time at Angola in Louisiana for sexual assault, narcotics, nothing big, really. His personal history includes being witness to an auto accident in which his high school sweetheart was killed and his mother was decaptiated. The seven year anniversary of that accident is in three days.",52
SCULLY,He's reliving it. That would explain the deadline.,8
MAN,"The most important element we found is that there's substantial suspicion that Luther Lee Boggs' last five murders were commited with a partner. Now, the police up in Durham say they could never prove it in court but they know that partner was Lucas Henry.",45
SCULLY,"You set us up. You're in on this with Lucas Henry. This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away. Well, I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you've done, four days from now, no one will be able to stop me from being the one that will throw the switch and gas you out of this life for good, you son of a bitch!",74
BOGGS,Dana... You're the one that believed me!,7
SCULLY,"No! No, I do not believe you!",7
BOGGS,"If you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe yourself. There was that one time when I was fourteen and my parents had gone to bed and I snuck downstairs all alone. Got one of my mom's cigarettes and went out onto the porch in the dark. I was so scared. My heart was beating, I mean, they would have killed me if they knew. But I was so excited. Not ‘cause of the cigarette, I mean, it was gross, but because I wasn't supposed to.",85
SCULLY,That could be a moment from any kid's life.,9
BOGGS,I know what you want. And I know who you want to talk to. Why don't you just go ahead and ask me?,23
SCULLY,I'll believe you... if you let... me talk to him.,10
BOGGS,"Starbuck... No, no, no! Nobody talks to anybody until I get a deal! Don't underestimate my fear of dying and don't downplay my terror of going back to that chair. I know my hell's going to be to go on back to that chair over and over again but in this life, my one and only life, I don't ever want to go back again! Ever! The last time I went to death's door and looked inside... I had never talked to a minister before in my life ever until that day and he said, ""He who doth not love remains in death and he who hates his brother is a murderer..."" ""And no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."" My family, who I killed after their last meal, was right there to watch me over mine... And their fear and their horror that I made them feel when I killed them was injected into me... And their collective fear alone was just one taste of hell. And then I felt myself leave my body. I thought they had already killed me... And I saw thousands of souls rushing into my body. It is a cold, dark place, Scully. Mulder's looking in on it right now.",207
SCULLY,It may be a cold dark place for you but it's not for Mulder and it's not for my father.,20
BOGGS,I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself but I'm not going to let him. Nobody speaks until you get me a deal.,23
SCULLY,I don't believe you.,4
BOGGS,"Oh well, there's plenty of room in that cold, dark place for liars, Scully. You go ahead and play it like you need to but I know you believe me. But if you need to convince a judge I'm in on it with Lucas, go ahead. ‘Cause either way, whether I'm running the show with Lucas or I'm channeling, no information's coming until I get a deal. Go on, man, I got nothing to lose.",75
SCULLY,Guard!,1
BOGGS,"If I die, that boy goes to that cold, dark place.",11
SCULLY,There's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers. The Raliegh police said...,14
MULDER,"No matter what, don't believe him. Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on death row. You'd be the next best thing.",28
SCULLY,"Mulder, I never thought I'd say this... but what if there's another explanation?",13
MULDER,Don't... deal with him. He could be trying to claim you as his last victim.,15
SCULLY,"All right, Mr. Boggs... you got your deal.",8
BOGGS,"Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.",5
SCULLY,"Alright, where are they?",4
BOGGS,"Uh... I... uh... I see, like, uh... circles. Uh... I don't know, like... barrels. No, no, bigger, like, uh... huge, uh... vats, uh... factory. Uh, condemned. The old, uh, Blue Devil Brewery up by Morrisville. Oh, God, he's getting, uh, he's getting ready. He... he... he's getting ready to, um, uh... he's getting ready to kill, uh, to kill the d... whoo.",62
SCULLY,"Luther, if you really were psychic...",6
BOGGS,I would have known you lied. That there never was a deal. I know you tried. Scully... Avoid the devil. Don't follow Henry to the devil. Leave that to me.,30
AGENT,Freeze!,1
SCULLY,"Federal agents, we're armed! Drop your weapon.",7
AGENT,There he is!,3
2ND AGENT,Get an ambulance...,3
AGENT,Hold it...,2
2ND AGENT,"It's gonna be alright, kid...",5
AGENT,Somebody get over here! Go away!,6
SCULLY,Go!,1
AGENT,Over here!,2
BOGGS,You come to say goodbye?,5
SCULLY,"I believe... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping, Lucas Henry would have... been aware of the danger you warned me about. He never would have crossed that bridge. So you saved... Jim Summer's life. But you saved mine as well.",41
BOGGS,"You come for some unfinished business? You want your father's message? Not now. Be there tonight. Be my witness. And when they got me in that chair and they... open up that shield... you get your message. into Luther's cell and puts down his last meal. Boggs looks to the left and sees his dead family again, in black-and-white. Boggs is wearing shackles as he walks down the same hallway. He sees his family lining the halls again, the same way in black-and-white. They whisper to each other. Boggs stops and turns around in emotional pain, but the security guards turn him back around.)",104
PRIEST,"Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven...",24
MAN,Would you like to make a statement?,7
PRIEST,"...our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is thy kingdom, thy power and thy glory... Forever and ever. Amen.",41
SCULLY,"I was considering Boggs. If he knew that I was your partner, he could have found out everything he knew about me. About my father...",25
MULDER,Scully.,1
SCULLY,"""Beyond the Sea"" was playing at my parents' wedding. Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena. If he knew that my father had...",26
MULDER,"Dana. After all you've seen, after all the evidence, why can't you believe?",13
SCULLY,I'm afraid. I'm afraid to believe.,6
MULDER,You couldn't face that fear? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you?,18
SCULLY,But I do know.,4
MULDER,How?,1
SCULLY,He was my father.,4
