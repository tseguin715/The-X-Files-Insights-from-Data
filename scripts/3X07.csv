ARMY DOCTOR,"I've reviewed your case and your service records. Combat duty in Panama... Grenada... distinguished service in the Gulf... great triumph and great tragedy. It's clear to me, Lt. Col., these suicide attempts of yours are simply just...",37
STANS,Cries for help!,3
ARMY DOCTOR,"You've tried and failed to kill yourself in as many weeks. Frankly, if you wanted to...",16
STANS,You don't understand... He won't let me. He won't let me die!,12
ARMY DOCTOR,Who? Who won't let you die?,6
ARMY DOCTOR,Just relax a moment. I'll be back with something to help you sleep.,13
RAPPO,"Stand down, Lt. Col!",4
STANS,NO! NOT THIS TIME!,4
STANS,NO! LET ME GO!,4
NURSE,Oh God!,2
FIREMAN,Where is he?,3
NURSE,In here.,2
STANS,I told you... He won't let me die...,8
STANS,I told you... I don't want to talk about it anymore. I told them and I told them and they won't listen.,22
MULDER,You mean they don't believe you.,6
STANS,"No, sir.",2
MULDER,You said on the report that at the time of the accident you believed there was somebody else in the room.,21
STANS,It was no accident. Don't you understand?,7
MULDER,But this person saved your life. Is that right?,9
STANS,Look at me... Look! I have no life... He took it all away.,13
MULDER,You have any idea who it is?,7
STANS,I never see him clearly. But he looks like a soldier... always standing at attention.,15
MULDER,A GI?,2
STANS,Or one of Saddam's boys... come back to hold me accountable. Whoever it is... he knows my name.,18
MULDER,He speaks to you.,4
STANS,"Your time has come, he said... Then he started taking it all away.",13
SCULLY,What did he start taking away?,6
STANS,Everything. My wife... my children...,5
SCULLY,And how did he do that?,6
STANS,How did he .. He burned them alive... Now he makes me suffer. Because he won't let me die. DRAPER Agents Mulder and Scully? May I have a word with you?,30
DRAPER,I've been asked to have you suspend whatever investigation you've begun here.,12
MULDER,"Asked by whom, Captain?",4
DRAPER,General Callahan. Lt. Col. Stans' commanding officer.,7
SCULLY,Is something wrong?,3
DRAPER,Protocol requires that all criminal investigation of military personnel to be conducted through military channels and their superior officer.,19
MULDER,"What, we didn't sign in at the front desk?",9
DRAPER,You're in breach of code and procedure.,7
SCULLY,"Excuse me, but is General Callahan the superior officer?",9
DRAPER,Ma'am?,1
SCULLY,"Assuming we would want to investigate him, who would we talk to?",12
CAPTAIN,Investigate him for what?,4
SCULLY,Whatever.,1
DRAPER,General Callahan is the senior officer.,6
SCULLY,Well then we'd like to speak to him on our way out.,12
DRAPER,I don't know that he's available.,6
SCULLY,"Ask him to make himself available. Tell him that its our protocol. In the mean time, we'd like to finish up with Lt. Col. Stans. You never know when he might try to kill himself again.",36
SCULLY,"Let's finish this, Mulder.",4
MAN,"I keep having the same dream almost every night. I know a lot of crips have the same dream. ""The Walk"". In my dream, I rise up out of my chair, and I can stand. I look down the hallway, I'm not in the ward anymore, I'm home. With my baby girl.",52
MAN,"Not even thinking about it, I take a step towards her... I take another step... and I pick her up and I carry her outside with me. With my own two feet. Outside is my little boy. We run together... Running! Me. My legs like they were before. We play a little bit of football... I show him a few moves... like my old man used to do. We just walk home. No crutches, no wheelchair. I know I'll never walk again, but this dream just seems so real. I can't help but think that maybe someday...",97
RAPPO,Don't hold your breath.,4
COUNSELOR,"I think we'd all be interested in your point of view, Leonard.",12
RAPPO,"Oh, you really want to know what I think? I pity all you guys, I really do. With your handicap basketball and your wheelchair races. You all act like we're normal people.",32
ANOTHER MAN,We are normal people.,4
RAPPO,"I don't know if you've had a look in the mirror lately, my friend, but you are missing a leg.",20
RAPPO,I don't have any! Where... where'd my arms go?,9
COUNSELOR,We all know how you feel.,6
RAPPO,"No, you don't. How the hell could you possibly know how I feel? There's only one way you could ever know. And I can only pray to God that he'll come down and take your legs and your arms away AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!",51
RAPPO,Roach...,1
COUNSELOR,"I'm sorry, gentlemen... let's begin again.",6
RAPPO,"What is it, Roach?",4
ROACH,What?,1
RAPPO,"You've got that ""I'm freaking out"" look on your face. What's the matter?",13
ROACH,It's nothing.,2
RAPPO,"Bull. I spent two years with your sorry ass in a gun turret, I think I know when you've got something on your mind. Come on, Private. Make your report.",30
ROACH,It's the FBI. They're downstairs. They're asking questions about the L.C.,11
RAPPO,The hell with the Feds. Roach? You hear me? The hell with them. Just forget about 'em.,17
DRAPER,General... Sir?,2
DRAPER,Agents Mulder and Scully to see you Sir.,8
GENERAL,"Thank you, Captain.",3
MULDER,General.,1
GENERAL,I want you to know I've had the Captain contact the Justice Department and let them know about the FBI's gross misconduct here.,23
MULDER,I guess this isn't a good time to thank you for seeing us.,13
GENERAL,"Let me assure you, this matter will not go unaddressed.",10
SCULLY,"I would hope not, considering the extremity to Lt. Col. Stans' case.",12
GENERAL,What case? There's no case. Stans is a very sick man.,11
SCULLY,"Yes, so we gathered. But his file is missing several interesting facts that came out of our interview with him.",20
GENERAL,I'm sure everything germane in Stans' situation is on file.,10
SCULLY,Except for any mention of the death of his wife and two children in a house fire three months ago.,20
GENERAL,"Well, it was a tragic accident.",6
SCULLY,No doubt. But there is no record of any criminal or arson investigation.,13
DRAPER,Stans tried to save his family that night.,8
MULDER,"Well, according to him, he was prevented from doing so by some kind of phantom soldier.",16
GENERAL,Look. I've known Stans a long time and there's no doubt that he suffered terribly.,15
SCULLY,"Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... isn't that correct, Sir?",10
GENERAL,He served under me in the Gulf. Yes.,8
SCULLY,"Six months ago, Aiklen also lost his family to a house fire. Afterwards he received psychiatric treatment for delusional behavior. Telling the doctors that he wanted to die, but that somebody wouldn't let him.",34
MULDER,"Before throwing himself into a wood chipper on the hospital grounds. Now, unless that's procedure and protocol, I'd say that the incidents and details have been strangely overlooked, Sir.",29
GENERAL,"Hold on. Just who's under suspicion, here?",7
GENERAL,"Look. I make no excuses for the sadness of these men's lives, they're casualties of war. Once brave men who we can do little but feel sorry for. If you think there's more to it, you are seriously mistaken.",39
SCULLY,"That's your conclusion, General. But I'd hope you'll allow us the opportunity to come to our own.",17
MULDER,You really think the General's got something to hide?,9
SCULLY,No. I think he's got everything to hide.,8
MULDER,You don't think he's just closing ranks to protect his men?,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, I know this isn't what drew you to this case to begin with...",14
SCULLY,But I think it's very clear what's going on here.,10
MULDER,What's that?,2
SCULLY,"The general is protecting his men, but what he's protecting them from is prosecution for the murder of their families.",20
MULDER,Why would he do that?,5
SCULLY,I don't know. But I can think of several good reasons.,11
MULDER,Because they were his soldiers and he feels somewhat responsible for the tragedies that have played out?,17
SCULLY,That could be one.,4
MULDER,"Maybe he knows the deeper secrets to their madness, the biological weapons they were exposed to during the war. The cause of the effect.",24
SCULLY,"Considering the government's complete disavowment of Gulf War Syndrome, it's a pretty good reason to prevent our investigation.",18
SCULLY,But you're not buying it.,5
MULDER,"You know, what I can't figure out is why a man who so deliberately and methodically set out to commit suicide would leave the one entrance to the room unsecured. But then again, I obviously have a feeble grasp of Army protocol and procedure.",44
GENERAL,Come in.,2
DRAPER,"I want to apologize, Sir. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that earlier.",17
GENERAL,"I know that, Captain. This whole situation is unfortunate.",9
DRAPER,Is there anything more I can do?,7
GENERAL,"No. Go home and get some rest. We'll deal with it in the morning. Relax, Captain. That's an order.",19
DRAPER,"Yes, Sir.",2
RAPPO,"Your time has come, killer.",5
ANSWERING MACHINE,Fox.... my dream....,3
FORT EVANSTON'S OFFICER GYM 10,32 PM,2
GENERAL,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,General Callahan...,2
GENERAL,One of the detectives are saying Catherine Draper's death wasn't accidental.,11
SCULLY,"There are bruises around her neck and her shoulder, roughly the size of fingermarks.",14
GENERAL,Then someone drowned her?,4
SCULLY,The bruises and surrounding edema are consistent with a struggle. Will you be contacting her family?,16
GENERAL,She had no family. The Army was her family.,9
SCULLY,I'm sorry. Truly.,3
MULDER,"I talked with security personnel. Other than Captain Draper, they saw no one enter the pool last night and no one leave.",22
GENERAL,But the officers are saying she was drowned...,8
MULDER,"General, do you have a family of your own?",9
GENERAL,Yes. Why?,2
MULDER,"If the pattern we've seen is at all consistent, you and your family may be in danger.",17
GENERAL,Based on what? The death of my adjutant?,8
MULDER,Keep an eye out. Watch for anything out of the ordinary.,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, you're serious?",3
MULDER,"This is a military base, Scully. There's security everywhere yet nobody saw or heard a thing.",16
SCULLY,That's not so hard to believe. Her screams would have been muffled underwater. There would be no fingerprints.,18
MULDER,It also fits the MO of Lt. Col. Stans' phantom killer.,11
GENERAL,"Agent Mulder, what did you mean by that?",8
MULDER,"Well, just a word to the wise, Sir.",8
GENERAL,No. I mean anything out of the ordinary.,8
MULDER,Any unusual or unexplained phenomena.,5
GENERAL,"Last night, I saw someone in my office. He said my name, but when I turned around, he was gone. Then my phone machine went all snaky again.",28
MULDER,Again? This happen before?,4
GENERAL,"No. Not what I saw. But the phone calls, yes. Twice before at my home.",15
TREVOR,Mom! The mail's here.,4
TREVOR,MOM! MOM!,2
TREVOR,MOM! MOM! MOM!,3
FRANCIS,"What is it? What is it, honey?",7
TREVOR,"Mom, there's a man here.",5
FRANCIS,Who?,1
FRANCIS,Thank God you're home. I was trying to reach you. Trevor saw someone in the house. Just a few minutes ago.,21
GENERAL,Is he all right?,4
FRANCIS,"He's just in his room, but he's terrified. I'm shaking myself.",11
GENERAL,"Francis, these people are with the FBI.",7
FRANCIS,Is it about the break in?,6
GENERAL,Why don't you check on Trevor? I'll be right up.,10
FRANCIS,Why? What's happening?,3
GENERAL,"Francis, please. We'll talk upstairs.",5
GENERAL,This way.,2
GENERAL,"It just comes on. The phone doesn't even ring. At first, I thought it was a prank.",17
MULDER,Did you save the other ones?,6
GENERAL,No. I erased them.,4
GENERAL,"I even called the phone company to have them check the line. They looked through the whole house, they couldn't find anything wrong.",23
MULDER,Have you noticed any other kind of electrical interference? The radio or the television?,14
GENERAL,Nope. Not a thing.,4
SCULLY,There's someone in the backyard.,5
SCULLY,"There was someone out here, I'm sure of it.",9
SCULLY,Look.,1
MULDER,"You'd better call the police, General.",6
NURSE,You're going to feel a little stick here.,8
NURSE,"Okay, this is fine. I'll be back in a minute.",10
ROACH,"That was too close, man. Too close.",7
ROACH,"I'm not doing it anymore, understand?",6
RAPPO,What?,1
ROACH,"I said, I ain't doing it anymore.",7
RAPPO,"You owe me, Roach. I wouldn't be in this damn chair if it wasn't for you.",16
RAPPO,"Hey! This isn't about you and me, man. This is about all the grunts and all the crips and all the boys who came home in a BOX! The enemy must be defeated. And we're going to do it! You're going to do your part and I'm going to do mine.",51
RAPPO,"NURSE! Hey, what do you do, man, when I rap on the tank?",13
ROACH,"Get some, get some. Fire at will.",7
RAPPO,Good. You're all right. NURSE! Come on! This is killing me here.,12
NURSE,You'll have to learn to sit still.,7
SCULLY,Find anything?,2
MULDER,No. But I'm really beginning to like the tune.,9
SCULLY,"Well, we've been a bit luckier. Whoever startled the General didn't just leave footprints... he left fingerprints as well.",19
MULDER,Really? Where?,2
SCULLY,"Forensics just lifted two matching indexes and a thumb. On the mailbox next to the front door, and one on the door leading into the backyard.",26
MULDER,Want me to go run 'em?,6
SCULLY,They're on the way to the NCIC as we speak.,10
SCULLY,FBI! Open the door!,4
ROACH,Don't shoot! Don't shoot.,4
MULDER,Hands up. Hands up. Put your hands over your head.,10
ROACH,"Okay, okay, okay.",3
MULDER,Put your hands down behind your back. Cuff him.,9
SCULLY,"Mr. Freely, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",32
SCULLY,"If you want an attorney, we will get you one...",10
SCULLY,Captain Janet Draper... Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... Lt. Col. Victor Stans...,11
MULDER,General and Mrs. Thomas Callahan...,5
SCULLY,"We've got him, Mulder.",4
SOLDIER,"Watch your left flank, there.",5
TREVOR,Okay.,1
SOLDIER,Trevor? Hey Trevor!,3
SCULLY,"In addition to accessory to murder, you're looking at conspiracy, breaking and entering, commission of a felony on federal property...",20
ROACH,Can I get a cigarette?,5
MULDER,No!,1
SCULLY,"We know you weren't acting alone, Quentin. We know you had an accomplice.",13
MULDER,"How did he do it, Quinton?",6
ROACH,I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about.,10
MULDER,How did he get past the guards? How did he kill him? Trevor was only 8 years old.,18
ROACH,I don't know. I didn't kill anybody.,7
ROACH,I'm just the mailman.,4
MULDER,"What does that mean, you're just the mailman?",8
ROACH,Rappo's mailman.,2
NURSE,"Leonard Trimble, right?",3
SCULLY,If that's the man they call Rappo.,7
NURSE,"Well, that's him. What's he done?",6
SCULLY,He's a suspect in two homicides.,6
NURSE,Rappo? You must be making some kind of mistake.,9
SCULLY,How's that?,2
NURSE,There.,1
NURSE,See for yourself. He's a quadruple amputee.,7
SCULLY,Damn it! He lied to us.,6
MULDER,He said he was the mailman. What did he mean by that?,12
SCULLY,I don't know. I'm adding it to the list. Are you coming?,12
MULDER,I'll catch up with you later.,6
ROACH,He knows this place! He'll find me here! He's been here before!,12
ROACH,I'm not safe here!,4
GUARD,Hey! Keep it down in there!,6
ROACH,Get me out of here! He's going to kill me! Let me out! LET ME OUT!,16
GUARD,I'm not going to tell you again.,7
ROACH,He's going to kill me!,5
ROACH,He's here! HE'S HERE!,4
GUARD,You don't want to get him started again. He was pretty worked up about an hour ago.,17
SCULLY,Not as worked up as I'm going to be.,9
GUARD,Visitor. On your feet.,4
GUARD,"God, almighty.",2
MULDER,How did it happen?,4
SCULLY,Suffocation. The bed sheet was stuffed down his throat.,9
MULDER,Had anybody been in the cell with him?,8
SCULLY,He did it all by himself.,6
MULDER,Not likely.,2
SCULLY,Not likely?,2
MULDER,"Yeah. He had help. Scully, and he wasn't lying because I think the man who killed him was Leonard Trimble.",20
SCULLY,Rappo?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"He can't even walk, let alone kill somebody.",8
MULDER,You see this?,3
MULDER,This is an X-ray dental plate.,6
SCULLY,I know. You've been walking around with that thing since we got here.,13
MULDER,"No, actually, the ones I've been walking around with I had developed at the hospital.",15
MULDER,"See, this is the one I was carrying when we first met Stans... this one in the rehab room, in the pool, in the General's office, and this one in the General's house. All of them exposed to some kind of radiation.",42
SCULLY,From what?,2
MULDER,"From Stans' phantom soldier. I came down here wondering if it could be true, what Lt. Col. Stans was describing was a case of astral-projection.",25
SCULLY,"What you're saying is this man, Rappo, is leaving his body and floating around town killing people?",17
MULDER,"Practitioners claim that during a self hypnotic trance, the astro body can actually detaches itself and can float virtually anywhere, sometimes invisible, but sometimes appearing as a apparition. They even claim that the astro-body has psychokinetic capabilities that is far greater than the corporeal body.",45
SCULLY,Mulder... then why would he need Quintin Freely?,8
MULDER,"Well, maybe he needs a psychic connection to a place. A thing or an object... a letter! That's why Quinton called himself the mailman.",24
SCULLY,That's insane...,2
MULDER,Sometimes the only sane response to an insane world is insanity.,11
MULDER,Do you know anything about backwards masking?,7
SCULLY,"You mean, messages recorded backwards in songs?",7
MULDER,"Yeah, or on the General's answering machine. Check this out.",10
TAPE,"Your time has come, killer. Your time has come.",9
MULDER,Leonard Trimble?,2
RAPPO,"No, it's Fred Astaire.",4
SCULLY,"Mr. Trimble, we'd like to ask you a few questions about Quinton Freely.",13
RAPPO,Roach? What'd he do now?,5
MULDER,He's dead.,2
RAPPO,Well... serves him right.,4
SCULLY,How's that?,2
RAPPO,"How's that? Oh, he's only the guy that turned me into second base by getting my arms and legs blown off. Other than that, he was a real good guy.",30
MULDER,Why did you kill him?,5
RAPPO,What's wrong with this picture?,5
MULDER,"I read your medical record, Leonard. We know that you refused all efforts at rehabilitation. You've even refused to be fitted with prosthetic limbs.",24
RAPPO,Big deal... Maybe I don't want any of that crap.,10
MULDER,Maybe because you don't need it. Because you can leave your body anytime you want. Kill anybody you want to kill.,21
RAPPO,"If I could leave my body right now, I could think of something else I'd rather be doing.",18
MULDER,Like kill General Callahan's boy? Lt. Col. Stans' family? Sergeant Aiklen?,11
RAPPO,You're a real trip.,4
MULDER,"Oh, I'm a trip, because I figured you out? You're a soldier. You knew what you were getting into when you enlisted. Now you want to blame everybody else. Why do you want to blame your COs?",37
RAPPO,"I blame him for what happened to all of us. You don't know what it was like... You sat home and watched the war on cable TV like it was a damn video game. You have no idea about the guys that died. About the blood... the sand. What it feels like when a hit comes. Thing is, you just don't care, do you? You got your crude oil. Just change that station, right? Killer got his prime time. LC got his fancy little medals. Now, take a good look at me, WHAT DID I GET?! Nobody knows how I feel. They took my life away.",106
MULDER,So you took theirs.,4
RAPPO,"If I only could. Now if you're through questioning me, I'd like to get a little shut eye.",18
MULDER,No sleepwalking.,2
RAPPO,That's good. I haven't heard that one yet. Hardy-har-har. HALLWAY SCULLY? What do you want to do?,17
MULDER,Call General Callahan... tell him to stay out of his house.,11
GENERAL,Francis...,1
GENERAL,Honey. Leave that.,3
FRANCES,I know how it upsets you when his... toys are spread all over the place.,15
GENERAL,"We can handle this, Francis.",5
FRANCES,I don't want to handle it. I want my son back.,11
GENERAL,Frances?!,1
GENERAL,Frances!!,1
GENERAL,Oh...,1
GENERAL,"Oh, no.",2
GENERAL,My God... CAR,3
SCULLY,No one's answering and the machine's not picking up.,9
STANS,General?,1
GENERAL,Lt. Colonel.,2
STANS,What are you doing?,4
GENERAL,"You were right, Victor. He won't let you die.",9
STANS,Sir...,1
GENERAL,"He kills our wives and children, but he won't let us die...",12
STANS,"I know who he is, General. I know who he is.",11
RAPPO,"General Callahan, Sir. I've been waiting for you.",8
GENERAL,Who are you?,3
RAPPO,"One of your boys, General.",5
GENERAL,You killed my wife.,4
RAPPO,"That's right, Sir. I did, and the boy, too.",9
RAPPO,"Come on, killer.",3
RAPPO,"Come on, Killer Callahan, get some! GET SOME!",8
RAPPO,"Come on, Killer. Do it! Fire at will!! Come on, Killer, do it.",13
RAPPO,"Come on, Killer. You can do better than that. Come on.",11
GENERAL,You're going to suffer like the rest of us.,9
RAPPO,"Oh, you think I'm going to let it end this way? Do you?! Is that what you think?!",18
SCULLY,General?,1
SCULLY,General?,1
GENERAL,He wanted me to kill him. I stood down.,9
GENERAL,I'm done here.,3
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,He's having some kind of a seizure.,7
MULDER,"No, I don't think so.",5
SCULLY,Nurse!,1
MULDER,General Callahan!,2
RAPPO,Killer? Come on Killer.,4
RAPPO,Your time has come.,4
MULDER,General Callahan?!,2
SCULLY,He's non responsive.,3
SCULLY,Come on.,2
SCULLY,Put him on monitors and prep the crash cart. He's going into cardiac arrest.,14
NURSE,Okay.,1
SCULLY,And make sure the team...,5
SCULLY,Lt. Colonel!,2
SCULLY,"Get the keys, we have to open the door.",9
SCULLY,Open the door!,3
SCULLY,"Lt. Colonel, open the door!",5
MULDER,General Callahan... are you hurt?,5
GENERAL,I'm okay.,2
MULDER,"No evidence was found linking Leonard Trimble to the deaths of General Callahan's wife and son. Officially, the case remains open. The murders unsolved.",24
MULDER,"Leonard Trimble's family requested his burial at Arlington National Cemetery. The Army denied this request. Trimble was cremated, his ashes interred at a civilian cemetery in Tannersville, PA. Leonard Trimble's mission was not to kill his enemies... but to shatter their lives... to keep them alive. To suffer the pain that he charges against Lt. Col. Victor Stans after a lengthy investigation. Stans was released from the hospital and posted under medical supervision at Ft. Evanston.)",76
MULDER,"Amputees sometimes feel the pain of phantom limbs... ghosts of hands still clenching... legs, still aching.",16
MULDER,Is it not possible that Trimble developed a phantom soul? A malevolent psyche that took its revenge on those he held accountable?,22
MULDER,nan,1
(WHAT THE REST OF US HEARD,) It was war that destroyed Leonard Trimble's body... but his wounds went deeper than the loss of his limbs... What destroyed those parts of him that make us human beings? Those better angels of our nature? I cannot say.,39
