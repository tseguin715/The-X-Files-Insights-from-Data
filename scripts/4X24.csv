PANELIST,"Some feel that contact with other civilizations is no longer beyond our dream, but is a natural event in the history of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of us.",34
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
VOICE,Let her through.,3
DETECTIVE,"Detective Rempulski, Alexandria P.D. Thanks for coming down to do this. It him?",13
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
BLEVINS,"Agent Scully, please have a seat. Agent Scully, we've had a brief discussion, that will you restate the matter we're here to put to rest?",25
SCULLY,"Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X Files. As I am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical prospective on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, who's investigations into the paranormal were fueled by a personal belief that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12. I come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is my scientific opinion that he became over the course of these years a victim. A victim of his own false hopes and of his beliefs in the biggest of lies.",120
ARLINSKY,We're meeting the guide at base camp. He'll take us to the site.,13
BABCOCK,Has he seen it?,4
ARLINSKY,"Oh, yeah. He said it's unbelievable. BASE CAMP",8
BABCOCK,How soon til we can get to the site?,9
MAN,Right now? We'd be pushing it to get to the camp by nightfall.,13
BABCOCK,I'd rather sleep seeing it than lay awake all night wondering.,11
MAN,It will take some work.,5
ARLINSKY,I've waited all my life for this day.,8
BABCOCK,Let's do it. LATER LATER,5
MAN,We're here.,2
ARLINSKY,"My God, it's beautiful.",4
BLEVINS,"Agent Scully, I presume you have a basis for this break from Agent Mulder.",14
SCULLY,"Yes Sir. Recent events have shed new light on the factual and physical evidence that would serve to prove the existence of extra terrestrial life, which was the foundation of Agent Mulder's consuming devotion to his work.",37
BLEVINS,What factual evidence?,3
SCULLY,"Agent Mulder was recently contacted by man who's pursuit of this evidence seemed to coincide with his own. In his intense desire to believe, Agent Mulder was duped by this man. He was fooled by an act of scientific slight of hand calculated to perpetuate false truths, a larger lie. I am here today to expose this lie. To show the mechanism of deception that drew him and me into it. And to expose Agent Mulder's work for what it is.",81
SCULLY,So he toppled over me and down the stairs.,9
MRS. SCULLY,Hi.,1
SCULLY,"Speaking of Bill, is he coming?",6
MRS SCULLY,There he is.,3
SCULLY,"Look at you, my big brother.",6
BILL,Sorry I'm late. My ship got stuck in traffic. You get my birthday card?,14
SCULLY,"Yes, I did. Thanks for remembering this year.",8
BILL,"Well, once a decade...",4
BILL,How are you feeling?,4
SCULLY,"I'm fine. Let's get some dinner, huh?",7
BILL,"Yeah, starving. LATER",3
BILL,"Mom, I'll open some more wine.",6
MRS SCULLY,Okay.,1
FATHER,I feel awkward sitting here. I'm sure you do too.,10
SCULLY,"No, I'm sorry.",3
FATHER,"I've known your family so many years. Your mother asked me to come. That I might have a word with you. I know it's been some time since we've spoken ourselves, since you drifted from the church...",37
SCULLY,"Father McCue, I...",3
FATHER,"But a time of personal crisis, a threat to your health, going back to your faith is important and essential.",20
SCULLY,"Father McCue.. I appreciate my mother's concern, and yours. But I'm being treated for my cancer and taking every precaution.",20
FATHER,Faith can make you stronger.,5
SCULLY,"I haven't felt the need. I have strength and I... I'm not going to come running back now. It's just not who I am. I'd be lying to myself, and to you.",32
BILL,Dana... phone.,2
SCULLY,Excuse me. Hello?,3
MULDER,"Hey Scully, it's me. Sorry to interrupt your dinner.",9
SCULLY,"No, is something the matter?",5
MULDER,"Well, I need your help on something. I was just contacted by Doctor Arlinsky from over at the Smithsonian.",19
SCULLY,Contacted you about what?,4
MULDER,About something he found on a mountain in Canada.,9
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,"I'd rather not talk about it the phone, I just need you to meet me over at the Smithsonian.",19
SCULLY,When?,1
MULDER,Right away.,2
SCULLY,I'm on my way.,4
MULDER,You're going to have to apologize for me to your brother and mother. This is something that just couldn't wait though.,21
SCULLY,It's okay. Who's this... Arlinsky?,5
MULDER,He's a forensic anthropathologist that I've been in contact with over the last four years. Several years ago he was involved in an embarrassing UFO photo enhancement scandal. But he continues to profess his innocence.,35
SCULLY,What am I coming to see?,6
MULDER,I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to let you decide for yourself.,14
ARLINSKY,"By my rough estimate from the sediment in the ice core sample, the body you're looking at is over 200 years old.",22
MULDER,Perfectly intact.,2
ARLINSKY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,That doesn't make sense. There should be signs of gradation.,10
ARLINKSY,The position it was found in. Stuffed in a crevice at high altitude. He may have frozen fast enough to avoid being eaten.,23
MULDER,Does that fit geologically?,4
ARLINSKY,"The area where it was found, is in the terminal moraine of a glacier that has since receded. Over 200 years ago, where the alien was frozen was in the tree line so there might have been a thaw.",39
SCULLY,Who found him?,3
ARLINSKY,"A Canadian geodetic survey team. Along with a colleague of mine, Babcock. They're all still up there on the mountain.",20
MULDER,Who all knows about this?,5
ARLINSKY,I know what your first thought was. But the St. Elias range? It's an awful long way to go for a hoax.,22
MULDER,"If you're going to go, why not go all the way?",11
ARLINSKY,I circumspect myself. But the ice core samples that I took. They can't be faked.,15
SCULLY,You have the ice core samples here?,7
ARLINSKY,Yeah. One taken from each side of the body. 360 degree matching the integrity of the sediment. It's my sincere belief that what we have here is the complete corpus of an extra terrestrial biological entity. Absolute and unrefutible.,39
MULDER,Qualitatively indefensible. You go public with this nobody is going to believe you. You also risk never knowing for sure because the same people who bury the truth so assiduously will be in charge of its authentication.,37
ARLINSKY,"That's why I came to you. I need to get the specimen out so I can authenticate it. This body means everything to you, Agent Mulder. You could have the proof in your hands.",34
MULDER,And what do you want?,5
ARLINSKY,I just want the credit.,5
MULDER,You think it's foolish?,4
SCULLY,"I have no opinion, actually.",5
MULDER,You have no opinion?,4
SCULLY,"This is your holy grail, Mulder. Not mine.",8
MULDER,What's that supposed to mean?,5
SCULLY,It just means proving to the world the existence of alien life is not my last dying wish.,18
MULDER,"What about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny? This is not some selfish pet project of mine, Scully. I'm as skeptical of that man as you are, but proof... definitive proof of sentient beings sharing the same time and existence with us, that would change everything. Every truth we live my would be shaken to the ground. There's no greater revelation imaginable, no greater scientific discovery.",66
SCULLY,"You already believe, Mulder. What difference would it make? I mean, what would proof change for you?",17
MULDER,"If someone could prove to you the existence of God, would it change you?",14
SCULLY,Only if it were disproven.,5
MULDER,Then you accept the possibility the belief in God is a lie?,12
SCULLY,"I don't think about it, actually, and I don't think it can be proven.",14
MULDER,But what if it could be? Wouldn't that knowledge be worth seeking? Or is it just easier to go on believing the lie?,23
SCULLY,"I can't go with you, Mulder.",6
MULDER,Can you at least take a look at those core samples? Tell me if they're a lie? That's all I'm asking.,21
SCULLY,"What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder, what I had only learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized. And the doctors told me, sort of a miracle, it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day toward the inevitable.",51
MAN,What's that for?,3
BABCOCK,I don't know these men well. Do you?,8
MAN,Well enough.,2
BABCOCK,I'm going to be up here alone until you get back. I hope I don't have to use it.,19
OTHER MAN,I think you'd better have a look at this.,9
OTHER MAN,We were doing a lateral cut in the back quarter when I saw something in the ice. Right here.,19
MAN,What do you think that is?,6
BABCOCK,I don't know. A bubble... a weak spot...,8
OTHER MAN,Or a casing channel. A pour hole. Liquid poured in from the side or above somehow.,16
BABCOCK,Poured from where?,3
OTHER MAN,I don't know.,3
BABCOCK,The angle wouldn't make sense.,5
OTHER MAN,"Yeah, you're right.",3
BABCOCK,We'll never know until we get it out of there. LATER ON MOUNTAIN,13
LAB TECH,"The iron concentration density and temperature profiles are all consistent. There's a tight matrix of crystals of approximable center. Suggesting the quick freezing scenario we mentioned. Here at the terminus, you've got some particular hydro carbons, jet fuel pollutants found just about everywhere in the world.",46
SCULLY,But not in old ice.,5
LAB TECH,Don't misunderstand. This is old ice. This sample has numerous levels of sedimentation like the rings on a tree essentially.,20
SCULLY,So it hasn't been tampered with?,6
LAB TECH,"No, not that I can see here. Can I ask why you're having this ice sample tested?",17
SCULLY,Another agent asked me to.,5
LAB TECH,Do you know where this sample came from?,8
SCULLY,"From a site in the Yukon Territory, why?",8
LAB TECH,Some cellular material within the matrix...,6
SCULLY,Plant or animal?,3
LAB TECH,I don't know. It's what I'd have to classify as a chimera. A hybrid cell.,15
SCULLY,From what?,2
LAB TECH,"As I said, I don't know.",6
SCULLY,Is it capable of cell division?,6
LAB TECH,I don't know that either. I just now found them. I'd like to get them under our electron microscope. If that's okay.,22
SCULLY,Yes. Please.,2
MULDER,I thought you said there was someone meeting us.,9
ARLINSKY,"Yeah, a guide named Roston.",5
ARLINSKY,I don't get it. This had all been arranged. I don't know what to do. LATER,16
ARLINSKY,We should be able to follow this track all the way up to the site. LATER,16
MULDER,Funny place to take a nap.,6
ARLINSKY,God.,1
MULDER,He's been shot. He's our guide?,6
SCULLY,"Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Vitagliano. Dr. Vitagliano, is he here?",12
KRITSCHGAU,"No, I'm afraid not.",4
SCULLY,"I'm supposed to meet him here. Actually, I a little late.",11
KRITSCHGAU,Sorry.,1
ARLINSKY,"Oh, my God! They're all dead! They've been shot.",9
ARLINSKY,Babcock! The body...! It's gone! They took it! No one knew. We didn't tell a soul.,16
MULDER,They had radio communication. Maybe it was being monitored. Someone's still alive.,12
ARLINSKY,It's Babcock.,2
MULDER,"Get him some water. Look's like he took a shotgun hit, but it didn't open him up too badly. The bleeding stopped.",22
ARLINSKY,"Who did this? They took the body, Babcock.",8
BABCOCK,No. I buried it.,4
ARLINSKY,Where?,1
BILL,Dana?,1
SCULLY,Bill. What are you doing here?,6
BILL,I picked up the phone when you called Mom's. They said you could use a change of clothes.,18
SCULLY,Thank you. Um. Where's Mom?,5
BILL,"I didn't tell Mom what happened. So, what did happen?",10
SCULLY,"I was... ahhh... knocked down a flight of stairs, but I'm okay, luckily.",13
BILL,"You're not okay, Dana. I know about your cancer.",9
SCULLY,I told Mom not to tell you.,7
BILL,Why?,1
SCULLY,Because it's very personal... Because I don't want sympathy.,9
BILL,"You think you can cure yourself. Mom tells me that you've gotten worse, that your cancer's gone into your bloodstream. What are you doing at work, gettin' knocked down, beaten up? What are you trying to prove? That you're gonna go out fighting?!",43
SCULLY,"Oh, now come on, Bill...",5
BILL,Do you know what Mom's going through? Why do you think I didn't tell her when they called?,18
SCULLY,What should I be doing?!,5
BILL,"We have a responsibility! Not just to ourselves, but to the people in our lives!",15
SCULLY,"Hey, look, just because I haven't bared my soul to you, or to Father McCue, or to God, it doesn't mean that I'm not responsible to what's important to me!",30
BILL,"To what?! To who? This guy, Mulder? Well where is he, Dana? Where is he through all this?",18
SCULLY,Thank you for coming.,4
BILL,Dana...,1
ARLINSKY,We should be able to do a good enough examination of the body right here to remove any doubt.,19
MULDER,We won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating test.,12
ARLINSKY,"Well, I'm betting his physiology alone will be tell tale.",10
MULDER,The Piltdown Man Hoax wasn't uncovered for forty years until it failed the carbon dating test. And that wasn't even very good.,22
BABCOCK,"If this were a hoax, there are 6 dead men up there on that mountain. There sure as hell is somebody else who believes it wasn't.",26
TECH,You well imagine it's a heavily traveled stairwell. We went back to the Bio Lab where we found an anomalous had latents. We found a partial match in the stairwell just four centimeters from one of yours.,37
SCULLY,Have you run it through the NCIC?,7
TECH,"Yep. This is your assailant, unfortunately he doesn't have a criminal record.",12
SCULLY,Try the federal data base.,5
TECH,I'll be damned! How did you know it would be a government employee?,13
SCULLY,Where does he work?,4
TECH,Right here in Washington. Michael Kritschgau... formerly of the US Army... now attached to the Pentagon Research division in Virginia. Is this the man?,24
ARLINSKY,"The body is 147 centimeters long. Weighing 24 kilograms deliquesced. Derma is hairless, grey with an elephantine texture. There are small eruptions on the surface of the skin most likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice. Otherwise, there appears to be no scarring... no identifying marks... the circumference of the head is 64 centimeters. There are four digits on each hand. Three on each foot. Sex is... undeterminable. The eyes are black covered by what appears to be a thin membrane which I am now removing. The tissue underneath seems to be semi gelatinous with a fine network of veins through out. Examination of the chest cavity confirms the presence of what appears to be a cardio-pulmonary system... heart, lungs, all identifiable. Within a mass of white string like tissue that doesn't appear to correspond to human physiology.",142
SCULLY,STOP! FEDERAL AGENT! HOLD IT! MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU?! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST! Identify your location! GET OUT OF THE CAR! NOW! MOVE!,21
KRITSCHGAU,Please don't shoot. I didn't mean to hurt you. I had no choice.,13
SCULLY,Put your hands on the car.,6
KRITSCHGAU,"If you arrest me, they'll kill me.",7
SCULLY,I don't know what you're talking about.,7
KRITSCHGAU,The same people who are trying to kill you. The people who gave you your cancer.,16
ARLINSKY,"There's tissue culture to be done. DNA sequence and then analysis. And it would be wise to run a gas cromatograph and that carbon dated you suggested. But if this isn't alien, I don't know what it is.",38
MULDER,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,"I had reached agent Mulder at a warehouse just outside of Washington in Sethburg, Virginia. They had managed the frozen corpse by helicopter down the side of the mountain and across the Canadian border in a refrigerated truck. After conducting a limited physical examination Agent Mulder was ready to believe that the body was that of an extraterrestrial biological entity. That he had finally found the proof which had eluded him. Which would confirm not only the existence of alien life but of his sister Samantha's abduction.",87
BLEVINS,But this man Kritschgau had convinced you otherwise. How?,9
SCULLY,"He told me a story which detailed, point by point, the systematic way in which Agent Mulder had been deceived and used and how I as his partner I had been led down the same path. Losing a family member due to my allegiance and contracting a fatal disease which I was told was engineered by the men who responsible for Agent Mulder's deception.",64
BLEVINS,Were you able to convince Agent Mulder of these facts?,10
SCULLY,I was only able to convince him to meet me so that he might hear the story the way I had.,21
ARLINSKY,What the hell is this?,5
ASSASSIN,"Right there, Pork. How's the wound?",6
BABCOCK,I'll live.,2
ARLINSKY,What is this Babcock?,4
ASSASSIN,Get the door. Where did Mulder go?,7
BABCOCK,He got a call.,4
ASSASSIN,Is he a believer?,4
BABCOCK,"Oh, yeah.",2
ASSASSIN,Then we're the only ones who know.,7
BABCOCK,Right. MULDER'S APARTMENT,3
KRITSCHGAU,"The lie you believe, that they have cleverly led you to believe, Agent Mulder, is that there is intelligent life, other than our own, and that we have had contact with these life forms.",34
MULDER,So you're saying this has all been orchestrated? A hoax?,10
KRITSCHGAU,Which you've been used to perpetuate.,6
MULDER,You come by this knowledge how?,6
KRITSCHGAU,"Working for the DOD Watching a military industrial complex that operated unbridled and unchecked during the Cold War, create a diversion of attention from itself and its continued misdeeds by confabulating enough believable evidence to convince passionate adepts like yourself... that it really could be true.",46
MULDER,"And just by chance, you run into Agent Scully?",9
KRITSCHGAU,"I was just like you, Agent Mulder, suspicious of everything but what you should be. I ran the DOD's agitprop arm for a decade. I can show you records of disinformation dating back to the Korean War, before you were even born.",42
MULDER,Why come to me now? Why not four years ago?,10
KRITSCHGAU,"I have a son who's very sick. He served in the Gulf War... The lies are so deep the only way to cover them, is to create something even more incredible. They invented you. Your regression hypnosis, the story of your sister's abduction, the lies they fed your father. You wanted to believe so badly. And who could have blamed you?",61
MULDER,And the thousands of UFO sightings?,6
KRITSCHGAU,"Above top secret military aircraft, concept designed to feed hysteria.",10
MULDER,Evidence of alien biology?,4
KRITSCHGAU,"Unclassified, but naturally occurring biologic anomalies science will eventually explain.",10
MULDER,The body that was found?,5
KRITSCHGAU,"Meticulously constructed out of biomaterials created through the hybridization of differentiated cells. What are called chimeras. Frozen into place over the course of a year using sentiment and materials that would bear out its age, poured through a small channel drilled in the rock above.",45
MULDER,"They would have known that the body would be carbon dated, that it would be proved a fake.",18
KRITSCHGAU,"The body will never be tested, Agent Mulder.",8
MULDER,What do you mean?,4
KRITSCHGAU,"You were only meant to see it, to make you believe the lie, so that you might finally commit and go public with the news.",25
MULDER,This man is a liar.,5
KRITSCHGAU,"You can see for yourself, Agent Mulder. The body is already long gone.",13
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,Ah...,1
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,Arlinsky's dead.,2
SCULLY,So is this man.,4
SCULLY,"Who did this, Mulder? Mulder?",5
MULDER,"What we had here was proof, Scully, there's no way it could be anything else.",15
SCULLY,"You said it yourself, Mulder. More tests needed to be run.",11
MULDER,"Yeah, but, the ice core samples checked out. If the ice hasn't been tampered with, how could the body within be a fake?",23
SCULLY,"Cellular material found in the ice core samples were a direct match for what this man Kritschgau described. Hybrid cells, chimeras within the matrix.",24
MULDER,Do we know for sure that those cells are not extraterrestrial?,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, everything this man described. You can't just guess at these details. I'm sorry, but the facts here completely overwhelm any argument against them!",24
MULDER,Facts overwhelmed by the lies created to support them!,9
SCULLY,"Mulder, the only lie here is the one that you continue to believe.",13
MULDER,"After all I've seen and experienced, I refuse to believe that it's NOT true!",14
SCULLY,Because it's easier to believe the lie. Isn't it?,9
MULDER,"What the hell did that guy say to you, that you believe his story!?",14
SCULLY,He said that the men behind this hoax... behind these lies... gave me this disease to make you believe.,19
ASHLEY MONTAGUE,"What we generally mean is, of course, intelligent life, something resembling our noble selves. It's entirely probable that there ARE such intelligent forms of life in other galaxies, in the universe. And it is even more probable that many of these forms are vastly more intelligent than we.",48
ANOTHER MAN ON VIDEO,"I think there's no question but that we live in an inhabited universe, that has life all over it.",19
CARL SAGAN,"By finding out what the other planets are like, by finding out whether there are civilizations on planets among the stars, we reestablish a meaningful context for ourselves.",28
ASHLEY MONTAGUE,"I don't think we should wait until the encounter occurs, but that we should do all in our power to prepare ourselves for it.",24
ISSAC ASIMOV,"I can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying as establishing such communication with a so-called superior or, if you wish, advanced technology in outer space.",25
SCULLY,"Earlier this morning, I got a call from the police, asking me to come to Agent Mulder's apartment. The detective asked me... he needed me to identify a body...",29
BLEVINS,Agent Scully...,2
SCULLY,Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.,15
