REYES,Thanks for the beer.,4
DOGGETT,Thanks for the lift.,4
REYES,"So, big plans for the weekend?",6
DOGGETT,"Oh, huge. Microwave pizza, satellite TV.",6
REYES,Wow. Thanks for making my life sound exciting. Maybe we both need pets. They say people with pets live longer.,20
REYES,"There's dog people, and there's cat people. You are a dog person, John.",13
DOGGETT,How do you figure?,4
REYES,"You're faithful, you're dependable, you're without guile, you're very comfortable to be around. So why a cat?",17
DOGGETT,"Low maintenance. They don't expect much from you, so you can't disappoint 'em.",13
REYES,"I don't see you ever disappointing anyone, John.",8
DOGGETT,See you Monday?,3
REYES,Yeah. See ya.,3
ER NURSE,"One, two and three.",4
DR. JACK PREIJERS,Miss... ?,1
ER NURSE,Reyes.,1
DR. JACK PREIJERS,How you feeling tonight? You with us?,7
FADE TO WHITE,nan,1
REYES,Hello? Is anybody here?,4
STEPHEN MUDOCH,"Hello. It's okay. I was a little freaked out, too... at first.",12
REYES,Who are you?,3
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Stephen Murdoch. I-I don't even know if that matters anymore but my name is Stephen. Did you just look outside?,20
REYES,Where did everybody go?,4
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"I think the question is, ""where did we go?"" Were you in an accident?",14
REYES,I think I was hit by a car on my way home.,12
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"I came in with chest pains. Mr. Barreiro, someone new. I found Mr. Barreiro wandering around here same as you. He fell at a construction site where he used to work.",31
REYES,"No. No, I don't believe that.",6
VAL BARREIRO,Have you ever been dead? So how do you know you're not?,12
DOGGETT,"Hell of a thing to wake up to, huh?",9
DOGGETT,We stopped after work. She had a beer.,8
SCULLY,"Well, the man who hit her had fifteen. Don't do this to yourself, John.",14
SCULLY,"It's true, John. She's gone.",5
DOGGETT,I don't accept that. Look at her breathing. Her heart's still beating. There's got to be hope.,17
SCULLY,"There's no measurable electrical activity in her brain. Brain death is... indeed death, John.",14
SCULLY,I'm sorry.,2
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"The thing is, it's not that bad, once you get used to the idea.",14
REYES,"Have you seen this? It's nonsense, all of it. There's not a single sign on any of the walls here. Why is that?",23
REYES,"You say we're dead. This seem like heaven to you? A big, deserted catholic hospital?",15
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"I didn't say this was heaven. For all I know, it's... it's hell.",13
STEPHEN MURDOCH,I don't know anything for sure. Maybe this place is a way station; to what comes next.,17
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Where are you going?,4
REYES,I'm finding a way out.,5
DR. JACK PREIJERS,Jack Preijers. I'm very sorry for your loss.,8
DOGGETT,"Look, you two are the experts but there's got to be something more that can be done.",17
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Well, I wish there were. And I don't mean to make this any harder but I do have information you both need to hear.",24
DR. JACK PREIJERS,Your partner had a living will. She signed an organ donor card.,12
DOGGETT,Uh-uh. No way.,3
SCULLY,John...,1
DOGGETT,"Just slow down, all right?",5
DOGGETT,"She's lying there in one piece. There's no fractures, no damage to her skull. Does that add up to you?",20
SCULLY,"John, at the end of the day it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the diagnosis or her prognosis.",18
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"In these situations time is always of the essence. There is a woman in Minnesota who can be saved by your friend's heart. In a real sense, she will live on.",31
REYES,Mr. Murdoch?,2
REYES,Mr. Barreiro?,2
REYES,"You, stop!",2
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Monica?!,1
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Monica!,1
STPEHEN MURDOCH,What's happening to him?,4
REYES,"Oh, my god.",3
DR. JACK PREIJERS,I am so very sorry for your loss.,8
DOGGETT,They're burning up the phone lines down there. Arranging with all these other hospitals how to divvy up Monica. They say they could do it as early as tomorrow.,29
DOGGETT,Is there anything... anything at all?,6
SCULLY,I did note some minor swelling in the left anterior which is consistent with subdural haematoma.,16
DOGGETT,Minor swelling?,2
SCULLY,I-I don't know if that means anything. It's not like there's an exact formula for how much damage equals death.,20
DOGGETT,What about this?,3
DOGGETT,"This was monitoring her brain activity, right? Electrical impulses.",9
SCULLY,Yeah. She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded.,11
DOGGETT,Suddenly they just stop here. Right here. And if we can learn what this is maybe we can reverse it.,20
SCULLY,Agent Doggett.,2
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"Okay, so-so this woman you saw--she went through the wall?",10
REYES,"I don't know. She was here, and then she disappeared.",10
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"Disappeared? What do you mean, like Mr. Barreiro did? Barreiro.",10
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"Okay, okay, let's concentrate on one unexplainable event at a time here. What the hell happened to Mr. Barreiro?",19
REYES,My opinion? I think he died.,6
REYES,You can't die if you're already dead. Which backs up my belief that you and I are alive. I have no idea where she went.,25
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Hold on. If he's dead... and we're not... then where the hell are we?,14
DOGGETT,Dr. Preijers.,2
DR. JACK PREIJERS,I'll be there in one minute.,6
DOGGETT,"I'm wondering about this moment on my partner's EEG tape--8:11 P.M., When brain death apparently occurred.",16
DR. JACK PREIJERS,You're reviewing our records?,4
DOGGETT,"Well, no offense, but yeah. I just need to know if there was some change in Monica's condition leading up to this.",22
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Agent Doggett, if you're trying to build a malpractice case against me or this hospital...",15
DOGGETT,I'm not. I just want the facts.,7
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Whitney, could you pull the code notes from earlier tonight, please?",11
NURSE WHITNEY,Mm-hmm.,1
DOGGETT,"Look, Monica had a seat belt and an airbag protecting her through the crash. The ambulance crew said she was conscious at the scene. I just think there's something we're all missing.",32
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Well, I don't think this will help you any but this describes what my team and I did to save your friend. You can take it, copy it, study it at your leisure.",33
[CLOSED CAPTION,DR. JACK PREIJERS: If you'll excuse me... ],7
AUDREY PAULEY,"Uh, I-I'm a patient aide. I deliver the flowers mostly. Are you her husband?",14
AUDREY PAULEY,"You love her, though.",4
AUDREY PAULEY,She's not gone. Not her soul.,6
DOGGETT,I wish I could talk to her. I wish I could tell her. Guess I wish a lot of things.,20
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"Come on. You're not giving up, are you?",8
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Monica.,1
AUDREY PAULEY,I'm Audrey. I-I work at the hospital.,7
REYES,"Audrey, I'm Monica. Stephen and I just want to get out of here. Will you show us the way out?",20
AUDREY PAULEY,I can't. I can't help you.,6
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Why not?,2
AUDREY PAULEY,I came to tell you your friend... loves you very much.,11
REYES,My friend? Did you talk to John? Does he know where I am?,13
AUDREY PAULEY,They all think you're dead.,5
REYES,Wait! Give my friend a message. Tell him he's a dog person.,12
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Hey, Whitney.",2
NURSE WHITNEY,"Doctor, it's not my place to say, but you might want to review the code notes for tonight.",18
DR. JACK PREIJERS,Why is that?,3
NURSE WHITNEY,"Well, there was an injection you gave Miss Reyes that wasn't in the notes.",14
DR. JACK PREIJERS,I don't think so.,4
NURSE WHITNEY,"In trauma bay, I saw you administer the IV push. I assumed it was epinephrine.",15
DR. JACK PREIJERS,I have no memory of that. Anybody else see this?,10
NURSE WHITNEY,"Just me. But it happened. My only point being, if there is an investigation that's the kind of inconsistency malpractice lawyers love to get hold of.",26
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"Whitney, thank you so much for looking out for me.",10
REYES (V.O.),"There's cat people, and there's dog people. You are a dog person, John. You're faithful. You're dependable. You're without guile and you're very comfortable to be around.",27
REYES (V.O.),"I don't see you ever disappointing anyone, John.",8
NURSE,Get me some help in here!,6
SCULLY,What exactly are you thinking?,5
DOGGETT,She helped work on Monica. I started asking questions about what happened in the trauma bay and she very inconveniently drops dead.,22
SCULLY,You're thinking that somebody murdered her to cover something up.,10
DOGGETT,"Well, if it were you, how would you go about it make it look like natural causes?",17
SCULLY,"Well, I'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital. I'd use a small-bore needle to make it next to impossible to find an injection mark.",24
DOGGETT,"Next to impossible... That's why you're perfect for the job. Should probably test her blood, too, while you're at it, right?",21
SCULLY,Agent Doggett... I'm happy to do this for you. Just don't kid yourself that this is going to somehow bring her back.,22
AUDREY PAULEY,"Your name is John, right? She has a message for you. She says you're a dog person.",17
DOGGETT,Wait. Where did you get that? Who said that to you?,11
AUDREY PAULEY,I told you. She's not gone.,6
STEPHEN MURDOCH,"Look, I went through every last page of that before you ever got here. It's just nonsense, just like you said. There's not a clue in it.",27
REYES,"Maybe in itself it's a clue. This place looks pretty complete at first glance but really it's not. There's so much missing. Words, details. It's like a set. A movie set but like it was built by someone who couldn't quite grasp what it was they were recreating.",48
REYES,"Stephen, you okay?",3
REYES,"Stephen, talk to me.",4
MRS. MURDOCH,Does he feel any pain?,5
DR. JACK PREIJERS,It's just a matter of time.,6
DOGGETT,You live down here?,4
AUDREY PAULEY,"The-the nuns let me stay. I-I wanted to be a nurse, only I can't do much but they let me help out.",22
DOGGETT,This is this hospital. You made this? Why?,8
AUDREY PAULEY,I like to visit it. I sort of go... inside my head.,12
DOGGETT,You go into the model?,5
AUDREY PAULEY,I like it there. It's quiet. I used to have it all to myself but then some people showed up. Hospital patients. Your friend.,24
DOGGETT,This is where you say you talked to her? Right inside here?,12
AUDREY PAULEY,"Well... not so much like tiny people in a... in a model, but .. inside my head? Up here, I guess.",20
AUDREY PAULEY,You don't believe me.,4
DOGGETT,Audrey... you said that you saw some other people besides my friend. Other patients? Can you tell me who they are?,21
STEPHEN MURDOCH,There's so much... I'd do... differently.,6
REYES,What?,1
STEPHEN MURDOCH,Life.,1
SCULLY,I'll call you back.,4
SCULLY,Monica's parents are on their way from Mexico City. They're coming to say good-bye.,14
DOGGETT,"Well, they can say ""hello"" instead. Nobody's shutting off her life support system. Not with what I got.",18
SCULLY,What are these?,3
DOGGETT,"Patient files. Both men were declared brain dead, same as her. All three have something else in common, too. Check out the attending physician. BARRIERO, VAL / Pt. ID # 106549 / Med # 659855589784. On the same sheet, DR. JACK PREIJERS' signature graces the form.)",42
SCULLY,Dr. Jack Preijers.,3
DOGGETT,The guy is some kind of Dr. Death. He gets off on pulling the plug on his own patients. He did it last night to this guy Barreiro.,28
SCULLY,"Well, at the request of the family.",7
DOGGETT,"But what I'm saying is what if he poisoned Barreiro in the first place? Same as this guy Stephen Murdoch, same as Monica. Tox screen will prove it.",28
SCULLY,How did you come up with these two men's names?,10
DOGGETT,"If I tell you that, you'll think I'm crazy. But Monica's alive same as this guy Murdoch. And we got to help them both get back.",26
REYES,Steven stay with me.,4
DOGGETT,"Audrey, it's John Doggett!",4
DOGGETT,Audrey!,1
DOGGETT,I still need your help.,5
AUDREY PAULEY,I told you their names. Mr. Barreiro and Mr. Murdoch.,10
DOGGETT,"No, they're both dead now. Monica's the only one left. And inside an hour the hospital plans to cut off her life support. Now, I'm not going to let that happen--no matter what it takes. But I'm losing here. Nobody else believes she's alive. Nobody -- just you and me.",49
AUDREY PAULEY,I can't do anything. I only deliver the flowers is all I do. I can't help.,16
DOGGETT,"Audrey, I need you to talk to her. I need you to tell her what's going on. I need you to tell her that they're going to pull the plug. I need her......",33
DOGGETT,I need you to tell her to fight. I need you to tell her to show us some sign - anything -- that she's in there.,24
DOGGETT,I need her to understand.,5
DOGGETT,I don't know what the hell else to do.,9
AUDREY PAULEY,Monica?,1
AUDREY PAULEY,John wanted me to tell you something.,7
REYES,You gave him my message?,5
AUDREY PAULEY,He says you don't have very long. He says you have to give them some kind of sign.,18
AUDREY PAULEY,"I know, I... I-I'm sorry.",5
AUDREY PAULEY,Uh... I can't... do... anything.,5
AUDREY PAULEY,"There's... there's something wrong... you know, up here. And I can't help anyone. I deliver the flowers. It's all I do. And I have to even get help with that because I-I can't read what's on the little cards.",39
REYES,You can't read?,3
AUDREY PAULEY,I see it all jumbled up.,6
REYES,"This is your hospital. It's you who created it. It's all you, Audrey.",13
REYES,This place is all you. And that means you can make the rules work any damn way that you want them to.,22
REYES,You can help me escape.,5
REYES,Audrey?,1
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"You know, I've always wondered what was down here. I'm being accused of things Audrey. Terrible things regarding three patients of mine. Really, it's... it's beyond the pale.",28
DR. JACK PREIJERS,"You're not going to yell out, are you, Audrey?",9
SEGUE TO,nan,1
REYES,Audrey?,1
REYES,Audrey? Audrey!,2
REYES,"Audrey, what's happening?",3
AUDREY PAULEY,You have to go.,4
AUDREY PAULEY,This way.,2
REYES,"No. If I do that, I'll burn up. I'll die.",10
AUDREY PAULEY,No. Not now. But you have to hurry.,8
REYES,What about you?,3
AUDREY PAULEY,I know now. I know who told me to build it.,11
SCULLY,The transplant teams are in place.,6
DOGGETT,They're not cutting her up.,5
SCULLY,John... I'm still waiting for your argument. If you have something to convince me to convince the doctors that somehow she's alive.,22
REYES,John...,1
DOGGETT,"Where're you going, doctor?",4
DOGGETT,"Oh, god. Oh, no.",4
DOGGETT,Good night.,2
REYES,Good night.,2
