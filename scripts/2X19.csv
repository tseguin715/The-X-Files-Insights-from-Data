CAPTAIN BARCLAY,This is mutiny!,3
LT. HARPER,"No, sir. It's survival.",4
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,They'll come for us! They're sending help!,7
LT. HARPER,"By the time they get here, it'll be too late. It may already be too late.",16
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,Don't do this! That's an order!,6
SAILOR,Lieutenant Harper?,2
LT. HARPER,"Shoot me if you want, Captain Barclay, but I'm not waiting around so I can wind up like the others.",20
SAILOR,Cast off!,2
LISETTE CAPTAIN,Hit me.,2
LISETTE FIRST MATE,It looks like she's just drifting out there.,8
LISETTE CAPTAIN,"Mmmm... we're heading straight for her. This is the Lisette, Canadian fishing vessel CV233, please identify. This is the Lisette, come in please. Cut the engines and meet me up on deck.",32
VOICE FROM LIFEBOAT,Hello out there. Hey!,4
LISETTE CAPTAIN,We're throwing you a line. Grab it and we'll pull you in.,12
LISETTE CAPTAIN,Is everybody all right? Are there any injured?,8
MULDER,Scully. Thanks for coming.,4
SCULLY,What was so urgent that you couldn't tell me over the phone?,12
MULDER,"I didn't want to waste any time. A Navy destroyer escort, the USS Ardent, has been missing in the North Atlantic for the past 42 hours.",26
SCULLY,Missing?,1
MULDER,"Yeah, there's been no radio contact, no distress signals picked up. Search planes and satellites haven't picked up anything either.",20
SCULLY,You're saying that a ship and its entire crew just vanished?,11
MULDER,"Well, that's what it looked like until last night. A Canadian trawler picked up 18 survivors.",16
SCULLY,"Well, they must have reported what happened.",7
MULDER,Only one of those survivors is still alive. He's been taken into the ICU under heavy security.,17
SCULLY,What's wrong with him?,4
MULDER,"That's what I was hoping you could tell me. They won't let me in to see him, but because of your medical background, I was able to get you a clearance code. I want your opinion on this. His name is Harper, Lt. Richard Harper.",45
SCULLY,"Mulder, wh...?",2
MULDER,Meet me back in my office when you're finished. Thank you.,11
SCULLY,Excuse me. Is this Lt. Richard Harper?,7
NURSE,That's what his wristband says.,5
SCULLY,And he's been positively identified?,5
NURSE,All military personnel are fingerprinted. Those records were crosschecked at the time of admittance.,14
SCULLY,"Well, then I think there's been some kind of a mistake here. According to this report, Lt. Harper is 28 years old. Why hasn't a systemic workup been ordered on this patient?",32
DR. LASKOS,I wasn't aware that my diagnostic decisions required your approval. I'm the physician in charge of this patient. Let me see your clearance.,23
SCULLY,Can you tell me what's going on here? How can you explain what happened to this man?,17
DR. LASKOS,This clearance code is invalid. Where'd you get this? Who are you?,12
SCULLY,I am a medical doctor and I would like to see the autopsy reports on the remaining victims.,18
DR. LASKOS,I haven't got time for this. Give me my patient's chart and leave before I have you removed.,18
SCULLY,"Something very strange is going on here, Mulder.",8
MULDER,Did they let you in to see Lt. Harper?,9
SCULLY,"Yeah, I saw somebody, but whether it was actually the Lieutenant...",11
MULDER,What do you mean?,4
SCULLY,He looked about 90 years old. Off by about half a century. You don't seem too surprised.,17
MULDER,"I want to show you something, Scully. This was the course of the USS Ardent when she disappeared. Now, I've been tracking the points of departure and destination for each of these X-files. On December 12, 1949, a Royal Navy battleship disappeared between Leeds and Cape Perry. The sea was calm, the weather sunny. In 1963, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, a fleet of Soviet minesweepers left from here for Havana. All 6 vessels vanished without a trace. All in all, I've counted 9 unexplained disappearances. Each of them passed through here - the 65th parallel.",98
SCULLY,Another Bermuda Triangle?,3
MULDER,"It's more like a wrinkle in time, if Lt. Harper is any indication.",13
SCULLY,A wrinkle in time? Wh...,5
MULDER,You know anything about the Philadelphia Experiment?,7
SCULLY,"It was a, uh, a program during World War II to render battleships invisible to radar. But then the Manhattan Project heated up, and it was discontinued and most of the scientists were relocated to Los Alamos.",37
MULDER,Except none of those scientists ever made it to Los Alamos.,11
SCULLY,Where were they sent?,4
MULDER,"Roswell, New Mexico.",3
SCULLY,Are you suggesting that the Philadelphia Experiment used alien technology?,10
MULDER,"Less than nine months after the alleged crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico, the USS Eldridge did more than just hide from radar screens, it disappeared altogether from the Philadelphia Navy Yard only to reappear minutes later, hundreds of miles away, in Norfolk Virginia.",46
SCULLY,"That's not possible, Mulder, not without defying all laws of, of time and space.",14
MULDER,Those physicists may have been trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth.,11
SCULLY,Wormholes?,1
MULDER,Actual portals where matter interfaces with time at a relatively decelerated or accelerated rate. I'm betting that the military never stopped the work it began 50 years ago.,28
SCULLY,And that's what you think happened to Lt. Harper?,9
MULDER,I'll find out soon enough. I'M BOOKED ON AN 8:30 flight to Norway.,13
SCULLY,Have you let Skinner in on this?,7
MULDER,I'm giving myself a 24-hour head start before I give Skinner my report. I want this one myself.,18
SCULLY,"I'm going with you. If that really was Lt. Harper, I want to know what happened to him.",18
NORWEGIAN SKIPPER/SAILOR,Nei! Nei! Det er altfor farlig,6
MULDER,0 for 5.,3
SCULLY,"What is it, Mulder? Why are they so afraid? My father spent the better part of his life at sea. He had a healthy respect for the ocean, but he never feared it. I see fear in these men's eyes.",40
TRONDHEIM,"Brooklyn couldn't have taken you up there anyway. Your ship has to be classified ice class before it can even go past the Lofoten Basin. My name is Trondheim - Henry Trondheim. The ship you want is the Zehar, a 50-ton trawler with a double hull. It's my ship.",48
SCULLY,You're American.,2
TRONDHEIM,I was born and raised in Pensacola. I ran a charter business there. I got fed up with tourists.,19
MULDER,How do you feel about the sea north of Beerenburg?,10
TRONDHEIM,"This time of year, it'll be 10 hours minimum, each way.",11
MULDER,So you've been there?,4
TRONDHEIM,A few times. A few times I got some of my best hauls out of there.,16
SCULLY,Why is everyone else so afraid to go there?,9
TRONDHEIM,"Well, legends. They grew up on stories.",7
SCULLY,What stories?,2
TRONDHEIM,A huge stone came out of the sky and crashed into the pack ice.,14
SCULLY,A meteorite?,2
TRONDHEIM,An evil god. They worship it by staying away. So... exactly what is it that you're looking for up there?,20
MULDER,A number of things. How good are you?,8
TRONDHEIM,"About as good as you're going to get, considering no one else will take you there.",16
MULDER,When can we leave?,4
TRONDHEIM,As soon as we shake on a price.,8
SCULLY,Feeling any better?,3
MULDER,Uhhh... You're lucky you inherited your father's legs.,8
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,His sea legs.,3
SCULLY,Oh.,1
MULDER,It's been about 12 hours. You said it was only gonna take 10. What's going on?,16
TRONDHEIM,"I told you before, the visibility is lousy. I've never seen it this thick.",14
MULDER,How much longer 'til we get there?,7
TRONDHEIM,"Well, we're right where you want to be. I even think we've got what you're looking for. Except one minute it's right in front of us and the next minute it's not. Like something's messing with my radar... and my navigation system. I can't explain it.",46
HALVERSON,Captain! Pass p√•!,3
TRONDHEIM,We're gonna hit!,3
TRONDHEIM,Halverson! Check the hull for damage!,6
TRONDHEIM,I don't get it. This is what you're looking for?,10
MULDER,The USS Ardent. It's a destroyer escort.,7
TRONDHEIM,"All right... what do you want with it, anyway? It's a ghost ship. I mean, look at all this corrosion. No one's been aboard this vessel in 20, 30 years.",30
MULDER,Scully. Let's check the crew quarters first.,7
SCULLY,Mulder. They almost look mummified.,5
MULDER,Like they've been dead a very long time.,8
SCULLY,Except for this strange residue.,5
SCULLY,What was that?,3
MULDER,An engine.,2
TRONDHEIM,My ship!,2
TRONDHEIM,No! That's my ship!,4
MULDER,Hey!,1
TRONDHEIM,You're taking my ship!,4
MULDER,Hey!,1
TRONDHEIM,Hey! That's my ship!,4
HALVERSON,Ta det med ro! Trondheim releases Mulder as the Zehar fades away into the fog and darkness.),17
SCULLY,Nope.,1
MULDER,All right. Try it again.,5
SCULLY,No. What is it?,4
MULDER,It's caked with the same residue that's covering everything.,9
SCULLY,So we can't even send a distress signal.,8
TRONDHEIM,"The engine's so corroded down there you can't even... you can't even tell what it is. I've never seen anything like it. Halverson's trying to salvage some parts, but basically what we are is dead in the water.",38
SCULLY,"Well, the radio's dead too.",5
TRONDHEIM,"Somebody's not telling me what's going on here. Now look, that ship wasn't just my livelihood, that was my life. I have a right to some straight answers.",28
MULDER,What we're seeing here may be the result of some kind of military experiment.,14
TRONDHEIM,Military experiment?,2
MULDER,"An artifical time band, where matter moves through time at an accelerated rate.",13
TRONDHEIM,Tell me in English.,4
MULDER,Time may be speeding up.,5
TRONDHEIM,"Right. That's almost as crazy as Halverson's ""there's a rock that comes down from the sky..."".",16
MULDER,The ship... the ship was launched in 1991. I don't know how else to explain the extent of the corrosion or the decay of the bodies down below.,28
TRONDHEIM,"You're not buying any of this, are you?",8
MULDER,What happened?,2
SCULLY,His skull's been fractured.,4
TRONDHEIM,Who was that? Halverson!,4
MULDER,Who are you?,3
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,"Captain Barclay. Commanding officer, USS Ardent.",6
MULDER,Here you go.,3
SCULLY,"Captain Barclay, um, according to your log, shortly after the navigation system failed, several of your crew members saw something in the sea - a growing light.",26
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,"It, it came up through the fog, in the middle of the night. Like it was on fire.",18
SCULLY,Do you have any idea what it might have been?,10
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,"Power loss. Everything stopped. Everything. Even the sea. Even the wind. Then the ship, my ship, she began to bleed through the hull near the rivet seams.",27
HALVERSON,"He's a drunkard. He's a drunkard! And he killed Halverson. To hell with him, I don't have to listen to his lies!",22
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,"I'm no liar. It happened, first to some of my men and then to all of them.",17
SCULLY,What happened?,2
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,Time got lost.,3
SCULLY,"It's OK, captain. You can take it easy. We're gonna do whatever we can to help you out.",18
CAPTAIN BARCLAY,What can you do? You can't do anything. I'm 35 years old.,12
MULDER,There's no way he killed Halverson.,6
SCULLY,"Yeah, I'd have to agree with you. That blow that killed Halverson was delivered with considerable strength, and he can't even hold a glass with two hands.",27
MULDER,That means there's somebody else on board.,7
TRONDHEIM,"You were a good first mate. You left me alone, and you did your job. It's a shame this had to happen to you so young.",26
TRONDHEIM,God vei videre,3
MULDER,Put it down! Put down the pipe! Put it down!,10
TRONDHEIM,I could kill you for what you've done.,8
MULDER,"Back off, Trondheim!",3
TRONDHEIM,He killed Halverson!,3
MULDER,He may be our only chance to figure out what happened. Look at him. Look at him! He hasn't aged. Back off!,22
TRONDHEIM,His name's Olafsson.,3
MULDER,You know him?,3
TRONDHEIM,"Everybody in Gildeskal knows him. He's a pirate whaler. He's a wanted criminal. He supplies whales to the Japanese black market. Blues, belugas, sperms.",24
MULDER,Ask him how he got here.,6
TRONDHEIM,Hvordan kom du hit?,4
OLAFSSON,Dra til helvete,3
MULDER,"We'll question him later. I don't want to leave Scully alone, in case there are others.",16
MULDER,I think we found who killed Halverson.,7
TRONDHEIM,"He'd have killed me too, if it wasn't for Mulder.",10
SCULLY,The ship's log says something about four Norweigian sailors who were picked up when their vessel had sunk.,18
TRONDHEIM,"I guarantee it was Olafsson's men, took my boat and left him stranded there. It's just like these dogs to slit each other's throats.",24
MULDER,Maybe we should ask the Captain some more questions.,9
SCULLY,"Mulder, Captain Barclay is dead. I don't know how it happened, it was just in the last 15 minutes. It's just like those men below. It's more than rapid aging, Mulder. It's almost as if he's turning into a pillar of salt.",42
MULDER,Is that what this substance is?,6
SCULLY,"Well, it appears to be crystalline, but beyond that...?",9
MULDER,"All right, we're all tired. Let's stow the captain's body and tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest. I'll take first watch, in case he's not alone.",30
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,Mmmm. I just fell asleep.,5
MULDER,You want a few more minutes?,6
SCULLY,No. I'm up.,3
MULDER,Scully...,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, what happened to you?",5
SCULLY,"Time acceleration is an equation, Mulder, a theory.",8
MULDER,Then theoretically it's possible. What else could it be?,9
SCULLY,"Well, whatever it is, it isn't a time warp. None of us has directly observed any of the phenomenon recorded in the ship's log. There is no hard evidence to indicate that this is a time warp.",37
MULDER,"We're the evidence, Scully! Look at us! We're aging by the minute.",12
SCULLY,"Well, if this is rapid aging phenomena, then why hasn't our hair greyed or started to fall out?",18
TRONDHEIM,"Then what about him, huh? What about him? Why isn't he getting old?",13
TRONDHEIM,Hvorfor blir du ikke gammel?,5
MULDER,"Relax, relax, Trondheim. Save your energy.",6
TRONDHEIM,I don't have to listen to you. It's because of you that we got into this.,16
MULDER,Nobody twisted your arm.,4
TRONDHEIM,I signed on to bring you here. Not to die.,10
SCULLY,"Mulder, what do you know about free radicals?",8
MULDER,Is this a quiz?,4
SCULLY,"They are highly reactive chemicals containing extra electrons. Now, they can attack DNA proteins, they can cause our body tissue and cell membranes to oxidize.",25
MULDER,"Grow old, you mean?",4
SCULLY,It's the prevailing theory on how our bodies age.,9
MULDER,So you think something is triggering that reaction in us?,10
SCULLY,"This is just a theory. But what if this ship is drifting towards another massive metallic source, like a meteor. Maybe it's way down deep in the ocean or embedded into an iceberg. But the two could effectively be acting as positive and negative terminals with the ocean itself being a kind of giant battery. That level of electromagnetic energy could be exciting the free radicals and effectively oxidizing every piece of matter in its field.",76
MULDER,"It makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent to rust would be rapid premature senescence.",14
TRONDHEIM,What the hell?,3
SCULLY,Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding.,7
MULDER,"It's not blood, Scully. It's rust. Trondheim, you keep an eye on Olafsson.",13
TRONDHEIM,Where are you going?,4
SCULLY,Mulder. Where are we going?,5
MULDER,"I'm not sure yet, but we don't have much time to get there.",13
MULDER,See this yellow pipe? It's the only one that hasn't corroded through.,12
OLAFSSON,"Hei, Trondheim, komme her. Det er noe jeg vil fortelle deg.",11
TRONDHEIM,Det er ikke noe du kan fortelle meg som jeg er interesserte i.,13
OLAFSSON,"Er du sikker? Hvor gikk de andre du, tror du? Og hvorfor tror du de etterlot deg?",17
TRONDHEIM,"Jeg vet hva du pr√∏ver √• gj√∏re, Olafsson.",8
OLAFSSON,"Hvis du ikke stoler p√• meg, s√• stole p√• de egne √∏yne. Du s√• hva som hendte til kapteinen. Det tar bare et par timer. Men du beh√∏ver ikke √• d√∏.",31
TRONDHEIM,Vi m√• alle d√∏.,4
OLAFSSON,Ikke p√• denne m√•ten.,4
TRONDHEIM,Hvorfor skulle jeg h√∏re p√• deg? Du er en l√∏gner og en morder.,13
OLAFSSON,Jeg bare drepte gutten for √• overleve. Du ville gj√∏re det samme. Du kan fremdeles gj√∏re det.,17
TRONDHEIM,"OK, jeg h√∏rer hva du sier. Fortell meg den store hemmeligheten.",11
OLAFSSON,F√∏rst la meg g√•.,4
TRONDHEIM,Hvordan vet jeg at du forteller sannheten?,7
OLAFSSON,"Se p√• meg, Trondheim. Og s√•, se p√• deg selv.",10
MULDER,Olafsson and his men.,4
SCULLY,Why would they hold up here?,6
MULDER,"This is the only drinkable water on the ship. We were both wrong, Scully. It's the water. All the other water's been contaminated.",23
SCULLY,Contaminated how?,2
MULDER,Something must have gotten into the desalination tanks where all the ship's potable water is stored. But the water in the sewage system is recycled again and again. It doesn't come from the sea.,34
SCULLY,"Well, if you're right, then Captain Barclay's drinking binge is what kept him alive.",14
MULDER,The water from this tank may do the same for us.,11
SCULLY,It doesn't sound like there's very much left.,8
MULDER,What happened? You were supposed to watch him.,8
TRONDHEIM,"I feel pretty bad about it. I shouldn't have dozed off. Well, what do you want me to say? He's gone, he got away.",24
MULDER,I want to know what happened?,6
TRONDHEIM,I can ask the same of you. You're the one that tied him up.,14
MULDER,There's nothing wrong with my knot! This rope's been severed!,10
TRONDHEIM,I don't like being interrogated. I don't owe you any explanations.,11
SCULLY,Trondheim!,1
MULDER,Let go of me.,4
SCULLY,"Look, we have a lot of work to do here. I'm gonna need blood and urine samples from both of you.",21
TRONDHEIM,What for?,2
SCULLY,We found out what caused the aging.,7
TRONDHEIM,"What is it now? The two of you are full of theories. First it's one thing, then it's another. By the time you figure out what it is, we'll all be dead.",32
MULDER,"It's the water, Trondheim. Something got into the de-sal tanks, but the water in the sewage system is untainted.",19
SCULLY,"It kept Olafsson alive this long, maybe it will slow the process in us.",14
TRONDHEIM,"This is good news, isn't it? So what happens now?",10
SCULLY,"It has been 18 hours, 45 minutes since the onset of symptoms. Rudimentary blood tests have revealed impossibly high concentrations of sodium choloride - salt - though the contaminated water itself is not saline. It appears to catalyze existing body fluids, causing massive and rapid cellular damage. The untainted water has slowed the degenerative progression in Trondheim and me, but Mulder has fared less well, perhaps because of the dehydration he suffered on the way here.",74
MULDER,I think I just lapped George Burns.,7
SCULLY,I'll be right back.,4
SCULLY,"If you've got something to say, say it but don't hover behind me like that.",15
TRONDHEIM,The water isn't helping him.,5
SCULLY,Then maybe we should double his rations.,7
TRONDHEIM,What for? A lake full of water isn't going to bring him back.,13
SCULLY,We don't know that for sure. Not yet.,8
TRONDHEIM,Look at him! We've wasted too much water on him as it is.,13
SCULLY,Who are you to decide?,5
TRONDHEIM,"You don't have to be a doctor to see that he isn't gonna make it. But you and me, Scully... you and me... we better start looking out for ourselves.",30
SCULLY,"Mulder's urinalysis continues to indicate his kidneys' failure to excrete the substance I'm calling ""heavy salt"". Whether the untainted water taken from the sewage system is even helping him at all is unclear. What does remain clear to me is that I can't give up trying.",46
SCULLY,Trondheim! What are you doing?,5
TRONDHEIM,"Listen to this. You know what that is? It's a funeral bell. There's only a few gallons left, maybe less.",20
SCULLY,There's enough to keep us all alive for a few more days.,12
TRONDHEIM,Or one of us alive long enough to be rescued.,10
SCULLY,Don't come any closer.,4
TRONDHEIM,What are you gonna do? Shoot me?,7
SCULLY,"Trondheim, listen to me. The navy knows where we are. They know these coordinates and they're gonna be here soon. So why don't we just go back up into the mess hall...",32
TRONDHEIM,Why don't you just go ahead and shoot me if you think that I'm gonna let Mulder have another drop.,20
SCULLY,Trondheim! Trondheim!,2
MULDER,You're almost out of pages. It's good you kept a record.,11
SCULLY,"Trondheim's locked himself in the sewage hold. He's backflushed all the water and he's keeping it for himself. I looked everywhere and this is all I could find. It's sardine juice, half a dozen lemons and uh, the water from a snow globe. It's not Evian, but...",47
MULDER,You go ahead and drink it.,6
SCULLY,"No, Mulder!",2
MULDER,"It's the only logical choice, Scully. You're a woman. Your life expectancy is greater, and your body retains more water in fatty tissues.",23
SCULLY,That's more reason for you to drink it.,8
MULDER,You have a much greater chance of surviving until help comes.,11
SCULLY,"Don't do this, Mulder.",4
MULDER,"Don't be so stubborn, Scully. You know I'm right.",9
SCULLY,"Well, there isn't much liquid to make a difference anyway.",10
MULDER,There might be.,3
SCULLY,No.,1
SCULLY,What was that?,3
MULDER,"The outer hull must have finally corroded through, which means we're taking on water.",14
SCULLY,Mulder... the water.,3
TRONDHEIM,Uhhh! Can't open the door! Help me! Help me! Help me!,11
MULDER,"I always thought when I got older I'd maybe take a cruise somewhere. This isn't exactly what I had in mind. The service on this ship is terrible, Scully. It's not fair. It's not our time. We still have work to do.",42
SCULLY,"Mulder... When they found me, after the doctors and even my family had given up, I experienced something that I never told you about. Even now it's hard to find the words. But there's one thing I'm certain of. As certain as I am of this life, we have nothing to fear when it's over.",55
MULDER,I'm so tired.,3
SCULLY,You should sleep.,3
SCULLY,"Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at nothing more I can do for him, or for myself. Supplies are exhausted, no food or liquid consumed for over 24 hours. The outer hull most probably flooded, though for now the inner hull is supporting the ship's mass. Among Halverson's belongings, I found a children's book of Norse legends. From what I can tell, the pictures show the end of the world - not in a sudden firestorm of damnation as the Bible teaches us, but in a slow covering blanket of snow. First the moon and the stars will be lost in a dense white fog, then the rivers and the lakes and the sea will freeze over. And finally a wolf named Skoll will open his jaws and eat the sun, sending the world into an everlasting night. I think I hear the wolf at the door.",145
DR. LASKOS,"Agent Scully? Agent Scully, can you hear me?",8
SCULLY,Mmmm. Yeah.,2
DR. LASKOS,It's been 36 hours since your rescue. I've got you on dialysis with a high-flux filter. You're obviously responding well. Your electrolytes are almost back to normal and your fluid status has been corrected.,34
SCULLY,Mulder? Where is he?,4
DR. LASKOS,"His endocrine system was considerably more compromised than yours. Frankly, we didn't think that he'd make it - until we discovered this. Based on your observations, we're giving him a course of synthetic hormones, which seems to be working.",38
SCULLY,Whatever caused this is still out there. I have to talk to a naval liaison. We have to salvage the ship in order to study the salt...,27
DR. LASKOS,"Agent Scully, the ship was taking on water. It sank less than an hour after you were rescued.",18
