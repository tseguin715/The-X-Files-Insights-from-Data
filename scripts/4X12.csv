TONY OLIVER,Get it. It's in the back.,6
TONY OLIVER,Come on!,2
JACOB WEISS,It's all right. You don't have to do this.,9
ARIAL,No. I want to.,4
ISAAC,Why are you doing this?,5
JACOB WEISS,Come.,1
SCULLY,"His name was Isaac Luria. He lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, home to a sect of Hasidic Jews who have lived there since the late 19th Century.",29
MULDER,"It's an area also known for its history of racial tensions and hate crimes. Rosenbaum, Tawana Brawley..",17
SCULLY,And now Isaac Luria. He was murdered two days ago in the market that he owned. Severely beaten and shot five times at point blank range. The police ruled out robbery because the only thing that was missing was a video tape from the surveillance camera. The police found it early this morning.,53
MULDER,Where?,1
SCULLY,In the VCR of a 16 year old named Tony Oliver. That's him on the upper right.,17
MULDER,Has he been arrested?,4
SCULLY,"No, because he's dead. Apparently he was watching this tape when he was strangled to death.",16
MULDER,Very Old Testament.,3
SCULLY,Yeah. But with a new twist. The Brooklyn Homicide detectives contacted the FBI Civil Rights branch with an interesting set of fingerprints that they pulled off of the boy's body.,30
MULDER,Interesting how?,2
SCULLY,They belonged to Isaac Luria.,5
MULDER,Risen from the grave to avenge his own death?,9
SCULLY,Some people might assume that. It's probably what someone would like us to think.,14
MULDER,But you have your own idea.,6
SCULLY,I think this is a crime of hatred like the crime that spawned it. A hatred that goes back 4000 years but masquerading as something else here. A callow attempt at murderous retribution disguised as spectral justice.,37
MULDER,A resurrection hoax.,3
SCULLY,And not a very good one.,6
MULDER,"Yes, spectral figures are not often known to leave fingerprints. Casper never did.",13
SCULLY,Somehow the killer got a hold of Isaac Luria's fingerprints and we have been asked to prove how.,18
SCULLY,"Excuse me, sir. We're with the FBI. We'd like to speak with Arial Luria.",14
SCULLY,Is she home?,3
JACOB WEISS,"I'm Arial's father, Jacob Weiss. Why are you bothering her again? She's already spoken with the police.",17
ARIAL,"It's all right. Let them in. Please, come in.",9
ARIAL,We can talk in the study.,6
JACOB WEISS,"This is why you are here? This is what you come to ask? Here, in this house of mourning?",19
ARIAL,What is this?,3
SCULLY,We would like your permission to reopen Isaac's grave.,9
JACOB WEISS,No! The answer's NO!,4
ARIAL,Why does this have to be done?,7
SCULLY,We're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man. His name is Tony Oliver.,16
SCULLY,He's one of three suspects in the murder of your husband. We believe it was an act of retaliation and that the other two suspects are targets.,27
ARIAL,He's just a boy.,4
JACOB WEISS,"He's an animal. A monster, like the others animals that killed Isaac. Whose grave you're now asking us to desecrate so you can now protect them.",26
ARIAL,"Papa, please.",2
JACOB WEISS,"Where were you when Isaac needed your protection? When we called the police, they said we were paranoid, that there was nothing to worry about. They always say that when someone threatens the Jews.",34
MULDER,So there was a specific threat of violence?,8
JACOB WEISS,"The threat is always there. Just this morning, this is what I found under our door.",16
JACOB WEISS,"And now you come here not to help us, but to ask our help so you can impose justice to the only man who has taken justice into his own hands.",31
MULDER,We would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you can tell us who that man is.,19
JACOB WEISS,"Even if I knew, why would I tell you?",9
SCULLY,"Because this is a homicide investigation, sir, and you are required by law to assist us.",16
JACOB WEISS,I know all about your laws.,6
SCULLY,"Sir, I'm afraid that even without your consent, we can get a court order to exhume Isaac's grave.",18
ARIAL,Do what you feel is necessary. But leave us alone. Let us mourn in peace.,15
SCULLY,"I'm afraid he knows who killed Tony Oliver, Mulder, and he doesn't want us disturbing Isaac Luria's grave because he knows what we'll find.",24
MULDER,Maybe...,1
MULDER,"...but it's hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that. Anybody delivering justice to a people who have known that kind of persecution and hatred, why wouldn't they protect him?",33
SCULLY,Justice or revenge?,3
MULDER,"I'm not saying those kids deserve full prosecution under the law, but the hate mongering goes both ways.",18
SCULLY,"Yes, but the right to free expression doesn't extend to murder.",11
MULDER,"I bet whoever published that knows the boys who murdered Isaac Luria. They might have a guess at who killed Tony Oliver, too.",23
BJUNES,"Oh, sure I knew him. He's the man who owned the store right across the street. But I'd be lying to say I was surprised it happened.",27
MULDER,Why is that?,3
BJUNES,You know how they are. Always trying to find ways to make money off of honest folks who work for a living.,22
MULDER,Can you think of anyone who held a grudge?,9
BJUNES,I can't think of anyone who didn't.,7
MULDER,Did you?,2
BJUNES,"Why? I'm not under any kind of suspicion, am I?",10
SCULLY,"No, not directly, but these young men are and we have reason to believe that you know them. Their names are Derrick Banks and Clinton Maguire.",26
BJUNES,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with them.",8
MULDER,"Are you familiar with this? We think those kids are familiar with it, enough to incite them to the murder of Isaac Luria.",23
BJUNES,"You work for them too, don't you?",7
MULDER,Who?,1
BJUNES,"You know who, you look like you might be one yourself.",11
SCULLY,"We work for the FBI, Sir.",6
BJUNES,Who does the FBI work for?,6
BJUNES,"You call me paranoid because that's exactly what they want you to do. But there's one thing you can't call me, and that's a Zionist collaborator.",26
SCULLY,You take a long look at these photos. It may be your last chance to save their lives.,18
SCULLY,"One of their accomplices, a man named Tony Oliver, was found murdered this morning.",14
BJUNES,Why are you telling me this?,6
SCULLY,You haven't heard the rumors?,5
BJUNES,What rumors?,2
SCULLY,That Luria is back from the dead? That he's risen from his grave?,13
BJUNES,What kind of Jew trick is this?,7
MULDER,A Jew pulled it off 2000 years ago.,8
SCULLY,"We're just relaying the evidence, sir. You can draw your own conclusions. But I'm sure you wouldn't want to be endangering these young men's lives.",25
MULDER,Bless you. BACK ROOM COPY SHOP,6
BJUNES,Derrick?,1
CLINTON,Are you sure about this?,5
DEREK,"I heard them, man. I'm not waiting around to find out if it's true.",14
CLINTON,What's wrong?,2
DEREK,It's nailed shut.,3
CLINTON,There's some tools in the trunk.,6
DEREK,"I got it open, man. Get down here.",8
DEREK,"Hey Clinton, check it out.",5
DEREK,"Hey, Clinton, check it out. Clinton? Don't mess with me.",10
DEREK,"Oh... oh, man.",3
SCULLY,Ligature marks on the victim's neck are consistent with the vigilante's MO. Forensics come up with anything?,17
MULDER,"Yeah, second set of footprints, but the mud is too soft to take a mold.",15
SCULLY,I guess Clinton was here with Derek Banks.,8
MULDER,Looking for what?,3
SCULLY,Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution for Tony Oliver's death.,13
MULDER,"That seems kind of redundant, doesn't it? Messing up somebody you already killed? I think they came here because they were afraid.",22
SCULLY,Afraid?,1
MULDER,Afraid that man they hated enough to kill wasn't really dead.,11
MULDER,"Look, there goes your theory of how Isaac's fingerprints got onto the victim's body. What's that look like to you?",20
SCULLY,The body wasn't embalmed according to custom. Maybe it's postmortem lividity or some sort of tattooing. It's hard to tell with this stage of decomposition.,25
MULDER,What's this? A little bedtime reading?,6
MULDER,FIRE!,1
DEREK,You owe me for two weeks.,6
BJUNES,Where have you been? Is it true? You and your friends killed the Jew?,14
DEREK,Just give me my money.,5
BJUNES,What the hell were you thinking? I never told you to kill anyone. I never said to do that.,19
DEREK,"No? What did you expect me to do? Hide back here like you? Licking envelopes in the dark, calling them names?",21
BJUNES,We're working to spread the truth.,6
DEREK,"The truth? Man, you're as pathetic as they are.",9
BJUNES,I am exposing their lies.,5
DEREK,Those are just words. You think they killed my friends with just words?,13
DEREK,"That's right. Clinton's dead, too. Now I'd like my money.",10
KENNETH UNGAR,It's called the Sepher Vetzirah. The Book of Creation. The earliest known Hebrew text of man's mystical communion with the divine.,21
SCULLY,Is it ever buried with the dead?,7
KENNETH UNGAR,"No. In observance with the Jewish belief, the corpse is buried only in its shroud. No other worldly possession is allowed.",21
MULDER,Have they ever been known to spontaneously combust?,8
KENNETH UNGAR,"No. It's a book on mysticism, not mysticism itself.",9
MULDER,Is it printed on any special paper or any special ink?,11
KENNETH UNGAR,"No, it's just a book. Leather and paper. I suspect somebody might be trying to play a trick on you.",20
SCULLY,"There may be a possibility that moisture leaked its way into the coffin, into the binding and pages of the book. If the ground water was contaminated with arsenic or arson gas could have created a combustible mixture.",38
MULDER,Is there anything that distinguishes the particular Sepher Vetzirah from any other such books?,14
KENNETH UNGAR,There's a name imprinted or stamped on to the leather.,10
SCULLY,A name?,2
KENNETH UNGAR,"Yes, a Hebrew name. Weiss. Jacob Weiss.",7
SCULLY,Jacob Weiss.,2
ARIAL,Why do you want to see him?,7
SCULLY,There's been another murder. Another suspect in your husband's death has been found dead last night.,16
ARIAL,Where was this?,3
MULDER,Next to your husband's grave.,5
ARIAL,How does this concern my father?,6
SCULLY,Yesterday he expressed strong feelings towards this latest victim.,9
ARIAL,Those were just angry words.,5
SCULLY,And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene. This is escalating into something else Arial. Something that has to stop.,22
ARIAL,My marriage to Isaac... you have to understand how much it would have meant to my father.,17
MULDER,"What do you mean, would have meant?",7
ARIAL,"We got our marriage license a few weeks ago, but the wedding wasn't until today.",15
SCULLY,I'm sorry.,2
ARIAL,I'd like to show you something.,6
ARIAL,"It's a communal wedding ring made in Colon, a village near Prague. My father was an apprentice to the man who designed it.",23
SCULLY,It's beautiful.,2
ARIAL,"Uh hum. Every woman who got married in the synagogue wore this ring as a symbol that she was a queen, her husband a king. And a home... They made a castle... not only on their wedding day, but for the rest of their lives together. But most of those lives ended in one day in the spring of 1943. 9000 Jews were massacred after digging their own graves.",69
SCULLY,But your father survived.,4
ARIAL,Because he was 10 years old. He had small fingers to make bullets at a munitions factory.,17
SCULLY,"And through all this, he hid the ring?",8
ARIAL,"Even after the war he hid it, even from my mother.",11
SCULLY,Why?,1
ARIAL,"Because to him, it was a dead relic from a forgotten place. Until the day that I told him I was getting married, and for the first time in fifty years, he took out this ring. He said it was like his village was born again. He knew how much I loved Isaac.",53
SCULLY,"Arial, tell us where your father is.",7
ARIAL,I know my father. He would never kill anyone.,9
SCULLY,What if you're wrong?,4
SCULLY,Do you see him?,4
SCULLY,I'm sorry. We don't mean any disrespect.,7
MAN,Who are you?,3
SCULLY,We're with the FBI. We're looking for Jacob Weiss.,9
MAN,Why?,1
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,Don't move! Federal agent!,4
SCULLY,"You okay, Mulder?",3
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,Put your hands in the air where I can see them. Turn around slowly.,14
MULDER,"I got him, Scully.",4
SCULLY,"Mr. Weiss, we're placing you under arrest.",7
SCULLY,Come on. Let's go.,4
ARIAL,Where is he? Where's my father?,6
SCULLY,"We've arrested him, Arial, under suspicion of murder.",8
ARIAL,I don't believe you. It can't be him. Did he tell you he killed this person?,16
SCULLY,I think that's the direction it's going. Agent Mulder is in with him now.,14
ARIAL,I need to see him.,5
SCULLY,"Arial, I think you'd better get him an attorney, he's refusing legal representation.",13
ARIAL,I need to see him!,5
SCULLY,Okay. You ask Detective Barley down the hall. He'll give you a place to wait while your father is been processed.,21
SCULLY,Arial? I'm sorry.,3
MULDER,"Who killed them, Jacob?",4
JACOB WEISS,Our synagogue has been vandalized 13 times in the last year. I heard a noise in the attic. I went up to see what it was and he attacked me. It was self-defense.,33
MULDER,Hanging a man in self defense?,6
JACOB WEISS,Is it any worse than what they did to Isaac?,10
MULDER,"Is it any better? They found your book, your Sepher Vetzirah in Isaac's grave.",14
JACOB WEISS,So?,1
MULDER,"So, that puts you at a second crime scene.",9
JACOB WEISS,I'm guilty! What more do you want from me?,9
MULDER,The truth.,2
JACOB WEISS,I have given you the truth!,6
MULDER,There was someone else in that attic with you. Who was it?,12
JACOB WEISS,There was no one else.,5
MULDER,Then you're a liar.,4
JACOB WEISS,You don't know nothing about nothing and I have no more to say about this. I would like to see my daughter.,22
SCULLY,"You want to see the background check I ran? He immigrated to Israel after World War II where he joined the Irgun, Jewish military underground. He was arrested in 1959 by the British for a bombing that killed 7 civilians. He's a terrorist, Mulder. A killer.",46
MULDER,He's not our killer though.,5
SCULLY,"What do you mean? He gave a confession, I just stood here and listened to him.",16
MULDER,"I think there was a second person in that attic, Scully. Weiss knows it too and he's protecting whoever it is.",21
SCULLY,"Well, who? His daughter?",4
MULDER,No. Somebody big enough and strong enough to knock me down.,11
SCULLY,Who do you think it was?,6
MULDER,"Stick around, this could get interesting.",6
SCULLY,Where are you going?,4
MULDER,To see a man about a burning book.,8
ARIAL,Daddy. They say you confessed. Why are you doing this?,10
JACOB WEISS,To protect you.,3
ARIAL,From what?,2
JACOB WEISS,I think you know. They found my book in Isaac's grave.,11
ARIAL,That can't be true.,4
JACOB WEISS,No?,1
MULDER,There's something you didn't tell me... About the contents of this Sepher Vetzirah.,13
KENNETH,What is it you want to know?,7
MULDER,I want to know about the myth of the Golem.,10
KENNETH UNGAR,This is a mystical text. These pages are filled with Golems and vivics and demons of every size and shape.,20
MULDER,It's the Golem that I'm interested in.,7
KENNETH UNGAR,And I'm interested in why an FBI agent would be so interested in such a thing.,16
MULDER,That's what I was hoping you could tell me.,9
KENNETH UNGAR,The early Cabolists... they believed that a righteous man could actually create a living being from the Earth itself. Fashioned from mud or clay... This creature could only be brought to life by the power of the word. In practical terms...... by the direct application of certain secret letter combinations.,50
MULDER,Combinations found in that book?,5
KENNETH UNGAR,"See......these pages, they're basically instructions for animating the inanimate. And this... this passage here talks about inscribing a single word on the Golem itself.",24
MULDER,On the back of his hand?,6
KENNETH UNGAR,I'm impressed.,2
MULDER,What's the secret word?,4
KENNETH UNGAR,"Emet. See... Aleph, Mem, Tau... Creates the word, Emet.",9
MULDER,"I don't speak Hebrew, I don't know what that means.",10
KENNETH UNGAR,"Truth. Emet means truth. See, Mr. Mulder, therein lies the paradox... because the danger of the truth is contained in the word Golem itself. Which means matter without form, body without soul.",32
MULDER,So the Golem is an imperfect creation.,7
KENNETH UNGAR,"Oh, kind of a monster, really. Unable to speak or feel anything but the most primitive of emotions. It runs amok. It has to be destroyed by its creator.",29
MULDER,"Destroyed, how?",2
KENNETH UNGAR,"By erasing the first letter, Aleph. Emet becomes met... which means dead. Again, Mr. Mulder... the power of letters, not just to create, but to kill.",26
MULDER,Yeah...,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me. There's been another homicide.",7
MULDER,Who?,1
SCULLY,Herb Bjunes. I'm on my way to the print shop right now.,12
MULDER,"Okay, I can be there in ten minutes.",8
MULDER,A man with a mission. Look at all the energy he spent spewing his hatred.,15
SCULLY,"Well, he wasn't toiling in obscurity. This manifest lists hundreds of names, including our three murder victims.",17
MULDER,"Well, there's no way Weiss could have killed him.",9
SCULLY,"Yeah, I'll call the precinct and have him released.",9
MAN,Agent Scully?,2
DETECTIVE,"The image is fuzzy, but I think we've got a hit. There.",12
SCULLY,"Oh, my God. It's Isaac Luria. He's still alive.",9
MULDER,I'm not so sure about that.,6
SCULLY,"No. That won't be necessary. Well, the coroner matched Luria's dental records.",12
SCULLY,It was definitely his corpse in the grave. This video tape... it must have been altered some how. Planted by whoever is staging this hoax.,25
MULDER,"It's not a hoax, Scully. It never was.",8
SCULLY,"But if Luria is dead, Mulder...",6
MULDER,This is not Luria. Not really.,6
SCULLY,"Well, who do you think it is? Some kind of a ghost?",12
MULDER,"A ghost is spirit without form. I believe what we're looking for and what we're seeing here, is... is form without spirit. Something called a Golem.",26
SCULLY,A Golem?,2
MULDER,It's kind of a man made monster described in Jewish folklore. It's fashioned through mud and then animated through mystical incantation.,21
SCULLY,"Mud! Mulder, what are you talking about? And... for what purpose? Exacting revenge?",13
MULDER,"I don't think it was hate that created this, Scully. I think it was love.",15
MULDER,"Arial, it's Agent Mulder. Open the door.",7
SCULLY,It's not locked.,3
SCULLY,Arial?,1
MULDER,"She's not here, Scully.",4
SCULLY,How do you know?,4
MULDER,Because it's her wedding day.,5
JACOB WEISS,Arial? I know you're here. I know you can hear me.,11
ARIAL,"Leave us alone, Tata. You don't belong here.",8
JACOB WEISS,I'm your father.,3
ARIAL,Please go.,2
JACOB WEISS,Not without you. I'm not leaving without you.,8
ARIAL,I want to see him.,5
JACOB WEISS,He's dead. Isaac is dead.,5
ARIAL,No.,1
JACOB WEISS,"The boys... they killed him. Their hate took him from you and you tried bringing him back with your love. But what you brought back, you have to understand, Arial... It isn't him. It's an abomination. He has no place among the living.",43
ARIAL,"He said he'd call me back, Tata. We were talking on the phone about the wedding. Isaac said he had to go. There was a customer who needed him. And that he would call me back. But when I heard the phone ring later... something told me not to pick it up. A woman's voice was on the line. I didn't hear what she was saying... I didn't have to. I knew Isaac wasn't calling me back. I just wanted to say goodbye, Tata.",84
JACOB WEISS,I know. I know...,4
ARIAL,I didn't think. It was just a wish. They were just... words.,12
JACOB WEISS,Stay here.,2
ARIAL,I want to go with you.,6
JACOB WEISS,No.,1
ARIAL,Tata.,1
JACOB WEISS,No.,1
MULDER,"Hang on, I've got a knife.",6
SCULLY,His pulse is thready.,4
MULDER,Will he be all right?,5
SCULLY,If we get him to a hospital. Where are you going?,11
MULDER,To find Arial.,3
MULDER,Arial?,1
MULDER,We found your father. He's alive. He's going to be okay. I know about Isaac. Where is he?,18
ARIAL,I don't know.,3
MULDER,All right. Come on. We gotta get outta here.,9
ARIAL,No.,1
MULDER,"Come on, Arial.",3
ARIAL,No... Isaac?,2
MULDER,Stop or I'll fire.,4
ARIAL,No!,1
ARIAL,No! Stop...,2
ARIAL,Isaac!,1
ARIAL,I am to my beloved... as my beloved is to me.,11
ARIAL,I loved you.,3
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,Are you okay? I heard shots fired. What happened?,9
SCULLY,What is she doing?,4
MULDER,"Saying goodbye. ""Itgadal ve-itkadash shemei raba Be-alma di-vra chi-r'utei Ve-yamlich malchutei Ve-yatzmah purkanei Vi-karev meshihei Be-hayechon u-v-yomechon u-v-hayei de-chol beit Israel, Ba-agala u-vi-zman kariv ve-imru amen In Memory of Lillian Katz.",31
