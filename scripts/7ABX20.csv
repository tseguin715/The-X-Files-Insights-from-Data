FIRST MISSIONARY,Good afternoon. I hope we're not bothering you.,8
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Actually, I'm just...",3
SECOND MISSIONARY,We really won't take up much of your time.,9
BETTY TEMPLETON,I'm just waiting for a call...,6
FIRST MISSIONARY,"We're all waiting, ma'am... for the good Lord to call in his flock.",13
BETTY TEMPLETON,... from the cable TV people. I'm just moving in. God bless.,11
FIRST MISSIONARY,Good afternoon. I hope... we're not bothering...,7
LULU PFEIFFER,Yes?,1
SECOND MISSIONARY,You're... Weren't you...,3
FIRST MISSIONARY,"Yeah, didn't we just...",4
LULU PFEIFFER,Didn't you just what?,4
SECOND MISSSIONARY,Speak to you.,3
LULU PFEIFFER,Excuse me?,2
FIRST MISSIONARY,We just spoke to a woman who...,7
SECOND MISSIONARY,... could have been your twin.,5
LULU PFEIFFER,What are you talking about?,5
FIRST MISSIONARY,"Yeah, just down the street-- she's just moving in-- your spitting image.",12
SECOND MISSIONARY,You're really not going to believe it when you see her.,11
FIRST MISSIONARY,Ma'am?,1
LULU PFEIFFER,Go away! Get out of here!,6
COP,Cuff him!,2
MULDER'S VOICE,Betty Templeton?,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,Yes?,1
MULDER'S VOICE,We're with the FBI. We'd like to ask about an incident-- a possible religious hate crime in your neighborhood.,19
BETTY TEMPLETON,I just moved in yesterday. I don't know anything about any incident.,12
SCULLY'S VOICE,"Well, we have two young men in the car who say you do know something.",15
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Oh, my God. Those are the boys that were here yesterday. What happened?",13
MULDER'S VOICE,They were beaten to within an inch of their lives by each other after visiting the home of a woman living a few blocks over.,25
BETTY TEMPLETON,What woman?,2
SCULLY'S VOICE,"A woman who, by both young men's accounts fits your description.",11
BETTY TEMPLETON,"She, uh... lives around here?",5
MULDER'S VOICE,"Are you a practitioner of the occult, Miss Templeton? Wicca? Voodoo? Satanism? The black art of bodily bilocation?",18
BETTY TEMPLETON,Me? No. You know what they say-- everyone has a twin out there somewhere.,14
MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER,"No, we don't know what they say.",7
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Well, if there's someone who fits my description, why isn't someone talking to her?",14
WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY,"We went over to the house, but it's empty. No one lives there.",13
MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER,"Frankly, we're not even sure she exists.",7
MULDER,"This is an FBI fleet sedan from our Kansas City field office requisitioned by two seasoned agents there driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour by the female agent in a novel effort to kill her male counterpart. Now, you might think I'm going to suggest psychokinesis-- pk-- someone or something controlling the agents with remote, mind-bending power.",60
SCULLY,But it's not?,3
MULDER,Both agents sustained critical injuries. Their stories eerily similar...,9
MULDER,... as if they temporarily lost control of their minds unable to alter their behavior.,14
MULDER,"You may think that I'm going to say it's past lives unresolved or fate, stalking the agents like an animal...",20
SCULLY,... but you're not.,3
MULDER,"No, the interesting thing about these agents is they had worked together for seven years previously without any incident.",19
SCULLY,Seven years?,2
MULDER,"Yeah, but they are not... romantically involved if that's what you're thinking.",12
SCULLY,Not even I would be so farfetched.,7
MULDER,"You have any ideas, Scully, any thoughts?",7
SCULLY,"What I'm thinking, Mulder, is how familiar this seems. Playing Watson to your Sherlock. You dangling clues out in front of me one by one. It's a game, and... and, as usual, you're, you're holding something back from me. You're not telling me something about this case.",47
MULDER,Hmm...,1
SCULLY,"Okay, so these agents were investigating something.",7
SCULLY,"Something... much like what they themselves were almost killed by. Uh, something they came into contact with. Uh... Third party?",20
SCULLY,Two third parties. Twins? Relatives? A doppelganger?,7
SCULLY,"A corporeal likeness that appears unbidden from the spirit world the sight of which presages one's own death or... a double, conjured into the world by a technique called bilocation...",30
SCULLY,"... which in psychological terms represents the person's secret desires and impulses committing acts that the, uh, real person cannot commit himself... or herself?",23
SCULLY,"Mulder, the slide, please.",4
SCULLY,Yes!,1
MULDER,Don't go thinking I'm going to start doing the autopsies.,10
LULU PFEIFFER,"Excuse me. Hi, I applied for the sales job you posted.",11
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Ah, yeah, I remember. How could I forget?",8
LULU PFEIFFER,Excuse me?,2
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Uh, there's a problem with your application as I recall, Miss...",11
LULU PFEIFFER,Pfeiffer. Are you sure?,4
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Lulu Pfeiffer. Yes, you reside at 15527 Moreton Bay Street?",10
LULU PFEIFFER,"Not any longer, I've moved.",5
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,You moved?,2
LULU PFEIFFER,"Yes, and I don't have my new address yet.",9
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Actually, Miss Pfeiffer, that's what's sending up the red flag. You move a lot and there's also your employment history-- 17 jobs in 17 states in the past three years? You seem to have as many jobs here as you have addresses.",42
LULU PFEIFFER,I had a restless streak.,5
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Well, the copy business takes a motivated person.",8
LULU PFEIFFER,"Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee as you can see by my resume.",13
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,"Well, what I can tell is you've left a variety of palm reader.",13
LULU PFEIFFER,"Yes, but I am on a career path now.",9
SECOND CUSTOMER,"Hey, what's going on here? All my copies are black!",10
THIRD CUSTOMER,My machine's going crazy.,4
FEMALE CUSTOMER,Who's running this place?,4
FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER,I can start you immediately. There's a clean uniform in the employee washroom.,13
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,"That's quite a string of positions you've had, Miss... Templeton. 17 jobs in the last three years.",17
BETTY TEMPLETON,I would've listed more but there wasn't any room left on your form.,13
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,"17's plenty, believe me.",4
BETTY TEMPLETON,I think you'll find my former employers will only give the highest personal references.,14
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,"It's not your references, it's the jobs themselves. Mongolian barbecue chef, high-rise window washer, wild animal trainer?",17
BETTY TEMPLETON,I'm a highly versatile employee.,5
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,What guarantee do I have that you won't just up and quit tomorrow?,13
BETTY TEMPLETON,You have my personal word on it. I'm here in Kansas City to stay.,14
BERT ZUPANIC,Who is it?,3
MULDER,"Mr. Zupanic, it's the FBI.",5
BERT ZUPANIC,Excuse me?,2
MULDER,"It's the FBI, Mr. Zupanic. Open up.",7
BERT ZUPANIC,Give me a minute.,4
MULDER,Bert Zupanic?,2
BERT ZUPANIC,Yeah?,1
MULDER,"We're hoping you can help us find the whereabouts of a woman we think you're familiar with, a Betty Templeton.",20
BERT ZUPANIC,I don't know no Betty Templeton.,6
SCULLY,"Maybe you should take another look at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic. Five-foot three, red hair. Maybe I can jog your memory.",21
SCULLY,"Are you still pleading ignorance, Mr. Zupanic? Is that not you in last year's Fourth of July parade?",18
BERT ZUPANIC,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,And who's that sitting next to you?,7
BERT ZUPANIC,Her?,1
SCULLY,"Try Betty Templeton. We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic. She seems to have left town in a hurry.",18
BERT ZUPANIC,She did?,2
SCULLY,Mm-hmm.,1
BERT ZUPANIC,Didn't she used to live on Moreton Bay in a pink house?,12
SCULLY,"Alderwood, blue house.",3
BERT ZUPANIC,On Alderwood?,2
SCULLY,"Mr. Zupanic, do you have any reason to be lying to us?",12
BERT ZUPANIC,"No, sir. I mean, ma'am.",5
SCULLY,"Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I've no doubt we'll be in touch with you.",13
MULDER,You know what I'm thinking?,5
SCULLY,That Mr. Zupanic not only knows Betty Templeton and where we can find her but that he is hip to whatever she's into and that I should take a look at that house he mentioned on Moreton Bay Street while you go and find out from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly that he's clearly hiding about Betty Templeton.,59
MULDER,I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.,11
SCULLY,"Well, I guess that's why they put the ""I"" in the FBI.",12
JUKEBOX,"""I'm going to be standing on the corner of 12th and Vine Going to be standing on the corner of 12th Street and Vine.""",24
BERT ZUPANIC,"Let me get a double, Freddie.",6
FREDDIE,"I thought you're in training, Bert, my man.",8
BERT ZUPANIC,Would you just pour?,4
JUKEBOX,"""Well, I might take a train I might take a plane But if I have to walk I'm going just the same I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come.""",32
BERT ZUPANIC,Nice outfit.,2
JUKEBOX,"""They got some crazy little women there.""",7
BERT ZUPANIC,"Freddie, fire in the hole. Seven and seven for the lady and make it stiff.",15
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Oh, my God. How did you do that?",8
BERT ZUPANIC,Do what?,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,How did you know my drink?,6
BETTY TEMPLETON,I feel like you're looking right through me. Like you're reading my soul like a book.,16
BERT ZUPANIC,"Maybe you've had enough of that. You are in trouble, aren't you?",12
BETTY TEMPLETON,I don't know. I could be. What kind of trouble are you looking for?,14
BERT ZUPANIC,"You don't want to go home tonight, okay?",8
BETTY TEMPLETON,It just so happens I don't got a home to go to. Anyway... I'm Betty Templeton.,16
BERT ZUPANIC,Alderwood Avenue?,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,My God.,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,I'm shaking.,2
BERT ZUPANIC,"""Betty Templeton."" Oh, that's perfect.",5
BETTY TEMPLETON,I got to take care of...,6
MULDER,"Hey, Scully!",2
MULDER,I want you to meet a buddy of mine. It's Mr. Argyle Sapersteen.,13
SAPERSTEIN,Stein.,1
MULDER,"Saperstein, excuse me.",3
SAPERSTEIN,Ma'anish ta na.,3
[TD,"Hebrew, I'm told it means ""Yeah, so what else is new?"".]",11
MULDER,"This is my partner, Dana Scully.",6
SAPERSTEIN,Pleasure and an honor.,4
SCULLY,"So I take it from your posture, Mulder, you've solved this case.",12
MULDER,"Not solved it, but I have narrowed down the search for our perpetrator with the kind help of Mr. Saperstein here.",21
SCULLY,Narrowed it down to where?,5
SAPERSTEIN,Right down there.,3
MULDER,"Our mystery woman is indeed involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic, the man we spoke to at his hotel, who will be fighting here two days hence with the mystery woman almost undoubtedly in attendance.",34
SAPERSTEIN,"If it's the lady I'm thinking, she's not much to look at, but he says she brings him luck.",19
SCULLY,Bert Zupanic is a boxer?,5
SAPERSTEIN,A wrestler-- semipro.,3
SCULLY,So what? We wait around Kansas City for a couple of days until we can talk with this woman?,19
MULDER,"Well, there's lots to do here, and the barbecue's second to none right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus Mr. Saperstein's going to show me some in-your-face, smack-down moves so I can quit getting my ass kicked so often, right? Oh, and there's an art exhibit that traces the influence of Soviet art on the American pop culture, right? Unless, of course you've already found Betty Templeton.",64
SCULLY,"Well, finding Betty Templeton won't solve this case, Mulder. Not unless we find Lulu Pfeiffer.",15
MULDER,Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?,3
SCULLY,"Our doppelganger who lived, until yesterday in a pink house on Moreton Bay Street, but she's not a manifestation, Mulder, she's real and so is the path of destruction that she's left in her wake. Though there seems to be no connection of any kind between these two women, Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer have traveled city to city across 17 U.S. States, one alternately trailing the other for the past 12 years and wherever they have been, mayhem has followed. house and Lulu in the blue.]",87
SAPERSTEIN,Damn.,1
SCULLY,"It's not just car accidents and fistfights, Mulder. It's house fires and explosions and even riots.",16
SAPERSTEIN,The lady knows her stuff.,5
MULDER,Sholom alecheim.,2
SAPERSTEIN,Yeah. Yo' mama.,3
BERT ZUPANIC,Hello?,1
SAPERSTEIN,Where's my money?,3
BERT ZUPANIC,I got it. I'm bringing it.,6
SAPERSTEIN,"Yeah, that's what I heard last night. Now you got the feds on your ass.",15
BERT ZUPANIC,What?,1
SAPERSTEIN,"Good luck charm don't sound so lucky no more, Boychick. Maybe I should cancel the fight.",16
BERT ZUPANIC,"I'm bringing the money, okay? I'm bringing it.",8
SAPERSTEIN,"I'm having lunch at Froggy's. No money, no fight, Titanic.",10
BETTY TEMPLETON,Are you in trouble or something?,6
BERT ZUPANIC,"I'm just, uh... I got to be somewhere, okay?",9
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Why? What time is it? Oh, God, I'm going to be late for work!",14
BETTY TEMPLETON,"You were incredible. Why do I find myself so wildly attracted to you, Bert Zupanic?",15
BERT ZUPANIC,"You just can't help yourself, baby.",6
LULU PFEIFFER,Where were you last night?,5
BERT ZUPANIC,Where was I?,3
LULU PFEIFFER,Yeah.,1
BERT ZUPANIC,Well...,1
LULU PFEIFFER,"You said, ""meet me for a drink.""",7
BERT ZUPANIC,I-I...,1
LULU PFEIFFER,That's what you said.,4
BERT ZUPANIC,I was there and I was waiting on you.,9
LULU PFEIFFER,"Are you two-timing me, Bert?",5
BERT ZUPANIC,How can you say that? You're my good luck charm.,10
LULU PFEIFFER,Who is she?!,3
BERT ZUPANIC,"""Who is she?""",3
LULU PFEIFFER,"You do not want to get in the ring with me, mister!",12
BERT ZUPANIC,"Honey, listen. Come on, baby, there's nobody under there. You're acting crazy, sweetie!",13
LULU PFEIFFER,"Hey, I know this hairpin.",5
BERT ZUPANIC,"Oh, I can explain that.",5
LULU PFEIFFER,"You lovable lug, Bert Zupanic. I'm sorry, baby. This is mine.",11
BERT ZUPANIC,Of course it is.,4
LULU PFEIFFER,I just get so jealous. You forgive me?,8
BERT ZUPANIC,I forgive you. I'm in training. You got to go to work. You're late.,14
LULU PFEIFFER,"No. I'm just so wildly attracted to you, Bert Zupanic.",10
BERT ZUPANIC,"Hey, listen, good looks and charm-- what's not to love, all right?",12
LULU PFEIFFER,There's a lot to love.,5
BERT ZUPANIC,I know. Go on.,4
LULU PFEIFFER,But you are...,3
BERT ZUPANIC,"No, you have to go.",5
LULU PFEIFFER,Will you call me at least?,6
BERT ZUPANIC,"You bet. I'm on the phone now, okay? Bye, baby.",10
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Bert, did I hear voices?",5
BERT ZUPANIC,Voices? I didn't hear any voices.,6
BERT ZUPANIC,Oh.,1
SAPERSTEIN,"Where's ""The Titanic?""",3
BETTY TEMPLETON,What?,1
SAPERSTEIN,"Your boyfriend, the wrestler.",4
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Wow, talk about moves. I can't believe it. We barely just met.",12
SAPERSTEIN,"He's supposed to meet me, here.",6
BETTY TEMPLETON,He's coming here?,3
SAPERSTEIN,"He'd better be, if he wants that fight Saturday night.",10
BETTY TEMPLETON,I better go freshen up a little. I was just coming in for lunch.,14
SAPERSTEIN,"Zupanic, hey. Thought you were a no-show.",7
SAPERSTEIN,Talking to your girlfriend.,4
BERT ZUPANIC,My girlfriend?,2
SAPERSTEIN,Holy sugar.,2
SAPERSTEIN,"Now, how did she do that?",6
BERT ZUPANIC,Do what?,2
SAPERSTEIN,"I just saw her. I swear, I just saw her go to the can.",14
BERT ZUPANIC,She... just went... to the can?,6
SAPERSTEIN,Ten seconds ago.,3
LULU PFEIFFER,What are you doing here?,5
BERT ZUPANIC,I have a business meeting. Why don't I meet you outside in the park?,14
LULU PFEIFFER,"Uh, I was just going to get some lunch.",9
BERT ZUPANIC,"Perfect, we'll have a picnic.",5
LULU PFEIFFER,A picnic? We never do that.,6
BERT ZUPANIC,"Oh, yeah...",2
BERT ZUPANIC,Now.,1
BETTY TEMPLETON,Bert?,1
BERT ZUPANIC,"I have a little business to attend to, sweetie.",9
SAPERSTEIN,You got more than that to attend to.,8
LULU PFEIFFER,"Hey, Bert, I only got an hour...",7
SCULLY,Mr. Zupanic?,2
BERT ZUPANIC,"Hmm. What, uh... What happened?",5
SCULLY,"Uh, there was an incident. You were struck by flying glass.",11
MULDER,Did you lose something?,4
BERT ZUPANIC,Yeah. My good luck.,4
SCULLY,"Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?",8
SCULLY,"'Cause they're the ones who caused this and they'll do it again if we can't find them. Where are they, Mr. Zupanic?",22
MULDER,Excuse me. FBI.,3
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,Can I help you?,4
MULDER,"Yes, I'm looking for...",4
MULDER,... that girl.,2
SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER,Betty. This man's from the FBI.,6
MULDER,Betty Templeton?,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,I'm just getting off work. Could we maybe talk some other time?,12
MULDER,I think we both know why I'm here.,8
BETTY TEMPLETON,It's her fault!,3
MULDER,Lulu Pfeiffer.,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,She follows me around trying to ruin my life. I'm not going to let her ruin it this time. It's either me or her. I don't want to leave Kansas.,30
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully. I found her at Koko's Copy Center.",9
SCULLY,Betty Templeton?,2
MULDER,Yeah. She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's trying to ruin her life. She follows her wherever she goes.,17
SCULLY,"Well, Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's, too. And that's exactly what Lulu says about Betty, Mulder. Except she says that this is the end of the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.",32
MULDER,That's exactly what Betty said.,5
SCULLY,What's going on here?,4
MULDER,"I don't know, Scully. You're running this show. Why don't you tell me?",13
SCULLY,"Well, I think that this is more than just physical proximity, Mulder. I think that these women have some kind of a psychic connection.",24
MULDER,"No , Sherlock. Hey, Scully, uh... where's Lulu?",7
SCULLY,"She just took off, Mulder. She left work and she drove away.",12
MULDER,"She wouldn't be driving a little blue convertible, would she?",10
SCULLY,That's exactly what she's driving.,5
MULDER,"Oh, crap.",2
MANAGER,Can I help you?,4
SCULLY,"Uh, yes. I'm looking for someone. He was here speaking to an employee and, uh, I can't seem to reach him.",21
MANAGER,"Tall guy, dark hair?",4
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MANAGER,He left.,2
SCULLY,And you don't know where he went?,7
MANAGER,Couldn't say. However... I can tell you we have a two-for-one copy discount in effect.,15
SCULLY,How about Internet access?,4
MANAGER,Right this way.,3
SCULLY,Is he in there?,4
PRISON GUARD,Yeah. Sleeping.,2
SCULLY,Can you wake him up for me?,7
PRISON GUARD,Sure you want to do that?,6
SCULLY,It's important.,2
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,Will you two shut up or go away!,8
SCULLY,Mr. Danfous?,2
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,The sound of your voice is like a jackhammer on my eardrums!,12
SCULLY,"Mr. Danfous, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.",10
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,What's so special about you?!,5
SCULLY,"It's an FBI title, sir.",5
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,I know it is. I'm not stupid!,7
SCULLY,"Mr. Danfous, if you'll let me explain why I'm here we might be able to get you to bed a little bit sooner.",23
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,"Ah, what a relief!",4
SCULLY,"Mr. Danfous, through a lot of matching-up of documents that I have been able to compile on the Internet, and by comparing time and space and circumstance and by liberally applying the law of averages...",35
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,They could electrocute me quicker!,5
SCULLY,I believe that you may be the father of two daughters.,11
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,I'm no father!,3
SCULLY,"Using documents filed by a sperm bank in Sparta, Illinois and by the mothers who may have been impregnated by your donation...",22
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,I Yankee Doodled into a plastic cup!,7
SCULLY,"Well, be that as it may, sir, it is very likely that you are the biological father. And it is very important for their safety and for the safety of others that we get as much information as possible about your mother and your father and anything about your family tree that may be able to explain the reactions that are being caused by these two girls.",67
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,"A big, ugly dog lifted its leg on my family tree.",11
ANOTHER INMATE,Make room for daddy!,4
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,"Shut up, you fat ox!",5
BERT ZUPANIC,Hello.,1
BETTY TEMPLETON,You aren't answering your phone?,5
BERT ZUPANIC,I'm just screening my calls.,5
BETTY TEMPLETON,You sleep with me once and now you're avoiding me?,10
BERT ZUPANIC,"I got... big trouble, baby. I got just one shot left at the big time. Just one.",17
BETTY TEMPLETON,But you got your match tonight. Your name's up on the marquee!,12
BERT ZUPANIC,"I've lost my financing. You're my good luck, baby.",9
BETTY TEMPLETON,I am?,2
BERT ZUPANIC,"It was my good luck to meet you and if you could just... if you could help ""The Titanic"" find a way...",22
BETTY TEMPLETON,Find a way?,3
BERT ZUPANIC,They say I'm old. I'm washed up. All I want's a shot. If I don't get the money I'm gonna lose my chance.,23
BETTY TEMPLETON,Maybe I can.,3
LULU PFEIFFER,You're not answering your phone?,5
BERT ZUPANIC,Lulu?,1
LULU PFEIFFER,Someone else you were expecting? Well?,6
BERT ZUPANIC,"Baby, I got trouble. I got big trouble.",8
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,Where have you been?,4
MULDER,Seeing a side of Kansas City few men have the privilege to see.,13
SCULLY,What happened to you?,4
MULDER,I got sucked into a storm drain. The more pressing question is what the hell happened to Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer?,22
SCULLY,"I don't know, but I have been able to locate the nature of their connection. Both women are non-fraternal siblings from the same father.",24
MULDER,You've located him?,3
SCULLY,Yeah. He's here in the state pen.,7
ANGRY BOB DANFOUS,When is all this yammering gonna stop?,7
MULDER,And he's given you insight?,5
SCULLY,"Well, the biggest thing that I can figure out right now is he's probably the angriest man in the world, Mulder.",21
MULDER,Not as angry as those two women are going to be when they both realize they're in love with the one and only Bert Zupanic.,25
SCULLY,They're both after him?,4
MULDER,"Yeah, they're both in love with him. That's why they're both staying in Kansas City and they won't leave.",19
SCULLY,"Well, if they're the reason it doesn't explain what's happening, what's causing this phenomenon or how we're going to make it stop.",22
MULDER,"Look, Scully, I don't know. You're the one who's supposed to have all the answers. Somebody's got to get to that fight and keep those two women apart or else this time the is going to hit the fans.",39
INMATE,"Well, hi.",2
SCULLY,Mr. Zupanic?,2
CROWD,"Come on, Jimmy! Yay! Yeah!",5
SAPERSTEIN,You said you'd have my money.,6
BERT ZUPANIC,I'll have it. I-I swear I will.,7
SAPERSTEIN,"I'll call off the damn fight, Titanic. I'll have these people cursing your damn name.",15
BERT ZUPANIC,"I'm telling you it'll be here, don't worry. I promise.",10
BETTY TEMPLETON,Bert! Bert. I got it.,5
BERT ZUPANIC,How 'bout your buddy?,4
SAPERSTEIN,Let's get ready to rumble.,5
BERT ZUPANIC,"Oh, baby. I knew you wouldn't let me down.",9
BETTY TEMPLETON,It's you and me. All the way.,7
SAPERSTEIN,"Ladies and gentlemen, get out your seats and on your feets for our own hometown boy gone bad... Bert ""The Titanic"" Zuuu... panic!",23
BETTY TEMPLETON,Titanic!,1
BERT ZUPANIC,"Oh, yeah!",2
CROWD,"Let's take 'em, baby! Let's take 'em, baby! Whoo! Whoo! Come on!",12
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Whoo! Go, Titanic!",3
MULDER,Betty Templeton. My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI. Can you come with me?,16
BETTY TEMPLETON,I'm watching the fight.,4
MULDER,"Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.",8
LULU PFEIFFER,I can't believe this. What are you doing here?,9
BETTY TEMPLETON,What are you doing here? I'm Bert's good luck.,9
LULU PFEIFFER,He's mine.,2
BETTY TEMPLETON,Over my dead body.,4
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Stop it! Stop it! You're going down, lady! I'm going to kick your butt from here to Tuesday! Stick a fork in you, you're done!",25
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Hi, baby.",2
BERT ZUPANIC,Betty.,1
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Bert, keep it up! I love you, baby!",8
LULU PFEIFFER,Bert. I got the money.,5
BERT ZUPANIC,Lulu?,1
LULU PFEIFFER,"Kick his butt, Bert.",4
BERT ZUPANIC,Lulu.,1
BETTY TEMPLETON,Bert!,1
BETTY TEMPLETON,"Oh, my.",2
LULU PFEIFFER,"Oh, my God.",3
BERT ZUPANIC,What?,1
BERT ZUPANIC,Why...,1
SCULLY,50 million anonymous donations have been made to sperm banks across the U.S. Most have produced healthy offspring for single mothers or fertility-challenged couples while some of them have not.,30
SCULLY,"Bert Zupanic and his non-fraternal biological sibling both small-time bank robbers, part-time pro wrestlers, both with too many idiosyncratic behaviorisms to list stood a 27-million-to-one chance of ever meeting but they did.",32
SAPERSTEIN,"Damn, those are some odds.",5
SCULLY,Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer products of different mothers but the same father-,13
SCULLY,"... an angry drifter now doing time for counterfeiting-- chanced to meet 12 years ago, but couldn't seem to avoid each other's compulsively identical mannerisms, mannerisms attributable to their perpetually angry father.",31
SAPERSTEIN,Mm. What does it all mean?,6
SCULLY,"I've been thinking hard about that, Mr. Saperstein. I would like to say it has something to do with balance in the universe, the attraction of opposites and the repulsion of equivalents, or that over time, nature produces only so many originals that when two original copies meet that the result is often unpredictable.",54
SCULLY,"If four should meet, the result is... well, suffice to say it's better just to avoid these encounters altogether and at all costs. I think Agent Mulder would agree with me.",31
MULDER,Mm-hmm. Mmmm.,2
