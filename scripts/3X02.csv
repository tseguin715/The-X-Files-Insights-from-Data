ALBERT HOSTEEN,"To the Navajo, the earth and its creatures have great influence over our existence. The stories passed from generation to generation help us to understand the reason for our tears of sadness and our tears of joy. Animals like the bear, the spider and the coyote are powerful symbols to our people. When the F.B.I. man Mulder was cured by the holy people, we were reminded of the story of the Gila monster, who symbolizes the healing powers of the medicine man. In this myth, the Gila monster restores a man by taking all his parts and putting them back together. His blood is gathered by ants, his eyes and ears by sun, his mind by Talking God and Pollen Boy. Then lightning and thunder bring the man back to life. At the end of the ceremony, when the F.B.I. man had been healed, we heard the news from other Native Americans in the northern plains that a great event had taken place. Like the Navajo, these people have their own stories and myths. One of these stories tells of the white buffalo woman who came down from the heavens and taught the Indians how to lead virtuous lives and how to pray to the creator. She told the people she would return one day, then she turned into a white buffalo and ascended into the clouds, never to be seen again. But on this day, when the holy people had given the F.B.I. man a miracle, a white buffalo was born and every Native American knew, whether he believed the story or not, that this was a powerful omen and that great changes were coming.",276
SKINNER,I've got the digital tape.,5
SCULLY,You're lying.,2
SKINNER,"I've got it in my pocket. I took it out of Mulder's desk. Drop your weapon! Put it down, Scully!",20
SCULLY,No way.,2
SKINNER,I said put it down!,5
SCULLY,I said no! You're setting me up!,7
SKINNER,I'm trying to help you.,5
SCULLY,Then put your weapon down and sit down.,8
SKINNER,Not a chance.,3
SCULLY,"You said you weren't here to kill me, Skinner, now prove it.",12
SKINNER,I didn't come here to have a gun shoved in my face either.,13
SCULLY,"Damn it, Skinner!",3
MULDER,Drop your weapon! I said...,5
SKINNER,Back off!,2
MULDER,I said put it down!,5
SKINNER,What the hell is this? What are you pulling here?,10
MULDER,"You okay, Scully?",3
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,Get his gun. Give her the gun. Give it to her!,11
SKINNER,All right.,2
MULDER,"Now, I want an explanation.",5
SCULLY,I was warned that somebody would kill me... someone I trusted.,11
SKINNER,"I'm going to reach into my coat pocket and end this charade... all right? I assume you both know what this is? Now, I want an explanation.",27
MULDER,"Your cigarette-smoking friend killed my father for that tape, and then he killed me.",14
SKINNER,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,"I was a dead man. Now, I'm back.",8
SKINNER,What is on this tape?,5
MULDER,Defense department files that weren't supposed to exist. The truth about our government's involvement in a global conspiracy of silence about the existence of extraterrestrial life.,26
SCULLY,Give me the tape.,4
SKINNER,"Uh-uh, this tape stays with me.",6
MULDER,Give her the tape.,4
SKINNER,"If what you say is true, the information on this tape is valuable enough to kill for. Then it's the only leverage we've got to bring these men to justice. It's not going to do us any good if it falls back into their hands!",45
MULDER,"Then you better make sure it doesn't. Come on, Scully, let's go.",12
SCULLY,Where?,1
MULDER,There are truths out there that aren't on that tape.,10
SCULLY,"Mulder, I am...",3
MULDER,"Scully, whatever you're going to say...",6
SCULLY,I went to your father's funeral. I told your mother that you were going to be okay.,17
MULDER,How did you know?,4
SCULLY,I just knew.,3
MAN,"If you'd wait there, sir...",5
MARGARET SCULLY,"Uh, my daughter was brought here. I'm trying to find her.",11
DOCTOR,"Okay, all right, what's her name?",6
MARGARET SCULLY,Scully. Dana Scully.,3
DOCTOR,Melissa Scully?,2
MARGARET SCULLY,"No, no... that's her sister.",5
DOCTOR,"Well, we just had a Melissa Scully in surgery with a cranial gunshot wound.",14
MARGARET SCULLY,Missy? It's Mom.,3
DOCTOR,We took drastic precautionary measures due to the nature of the head wound. We've induced coma to try and relieve the trauma on the brain.,25
MARGARET SCULLY,Is she going to be okay?,6
DOCTOR,"We've done everything we can right now. We'll being monitoring her around the clock. Nurse, why don't we get Mrs. Scully a comfortable chair?",24
MULDER,That's my father on the left there.,7
BYERS,This was taken when?,4
MULDER,About 1973.,2
BYERS,"Amazing. Langly, take a look.",5
SCULLY,Do you recognize any of these men?,7
BYERS,Are you familiar with a post-World War II project known as Operation Paper Clip?,14
MULDER,Our deal with the devil. The U.S. government provided safe haven for certain Nazi war criminals in exchange for their scientific knowledge.,22
LANGLY,I know who this man is. Victor Klemper.,8
BYERS,"The man standing next to your father is one of those criminals, though not the most famous of the bunch. Wernher von Braun, designer of the V-2 rockets that leveled London, may be the most notorious, but Victor Klemper certainly takes the prize for the most... evil Nazi to escape the Nuremburg trials.",53
SCULLY,What did he do?,4
LANGLY,"He experimented on the Jews... drowned them, suffocated them, put them in pressure chambers. All in the name of science.",20
BYERS,"Together with Von Braun, Klemper helped us win the space race. Using his scientific data on the effects of high-altitude flying, we were able to put astronauts on the moon before the Soviets.",33
LANGLY,One giant step for mankind.,5
SCULLY,What would he be doing in a photo with your father?,11
MULDER,I don't know. Do you recognize anybody else in the photograph?,11
BYERS,No. Operation Paper Clip was supposed to have been scrapped in the 1950s but if this is 1973...,18
SCULLY,Whatever happened to Klemper?,4
LANGLY,"He's still here, living very well at the expense of the American taxpayer.",13
FROHIKE,Unbelieveable! We thought you were history.,6
MULDER,"You're going to have to wait a little longer for my video collection, Frohike.",14
LANGLY,Where were you? We were looking all over.,8
FROHIKE,"Down at D.C. general, I was scanning the police frequency when I heard the report of a shooting. Agent Scully...",20
SCULLY,"What, what is it?",4
FROHIKE,Your sister's in critical condition.,5
MULDER,"Scully... Scully, wait. Scully! Scully, wait! Scully!",7
SCULLY,"I have to go there, Mulder.",6
MULDER,You can't go.,3
SCULLY,That bullet was meant for me.,6
MULDER,"If they're trying to kill you, that's the first place they're going to look.",14
SCULLY,Those bastards...,2
MULDER,We're going to call someone I think can help. It's the only thing you can do for her right now is try to crucify them.,25
"46TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY; 7",09 AM,2
1ST ELDER,This is a serious mistake. An innocent woman has been shot.,11
2ND ELDER,Can this be traced?,4
3RD ELDER,This is your man.,4
CSM,There was a mistake. It will be rectified.,8
WELL-MANICURED MAN,By whom? By whom will this be rectified? Your ridiculously ineffectual assassins?,12
CSM,These men are professionals.,4
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"This is not a profession for men who make mistakes. My God, you presume to make us believe you can simply fix it with enough bullets?",26
CSM,No.,1
WELL-MANICURED MAN,This woman... Scully... I know she believes her partner is still alive.,12
CSM,Mulder's dead. I took care of it myself.,8
WELL-MANICURED MAN,And the computer tape containing the stolen files you tell us was recovered... you can show it to us?,19
CSM,I wasn't aware that my honesty was in question or doubt.,11
1ST ELDER,You have the tape?,4
CSM,Of course I have it.,5
2ND ELDER,I think I'd like to see it.,7
3RD ELDER,So would I.,3
CSM,I have vouchsafed it for reasons of security. I'll have it here for you tomorrow... by which time this whole matter will have been cleared up.,26
MULDER,Victor Klemper?,2
VICTOR KLEMPER,Yes?,1
MULDER,"My name is Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully.",9
VICTOR KLEMPER,Your name is Mulder?,4
MULDER,Yes. I think you knew my father.,7
VICTOR KLEMPER,What's this about?,3
MULDER,"When you came to this country, you did some work for our government.",13
VICTOR KLEMPER,I'm an old man now. History bores me.,8
SCULLY,Because it escaped you or because you escaped it?,9
VICTOR KLEMPER,"Freud, Salk, Crick, Watson... these will be the names they celebrate at the end of the millenium. Great scientists. And Klemper? He will be remembered only as a butcher.",29
SCULLY,History may be the only justice you'll ever know.,9
VICTOR KLEMPER,Do you know my work? Do you know what we accomplished?,11
SCULLY,As a Nazi or for the blood money we paid you?,11
VICTOR KLEMPER,We were young men caught in a fervor but our experiments changed the world.,14
SCULLY,For a lot of innocent Jews.,6
VICTOR KLEMPER,"Progress demands sacrifice, and I... I have confronted my demons. And soon I will die too.",16
MULDER,Like my father. They killed him and I believe you know why.,12
VICTOR KLEMPER,I believe they would kill anyone if it is in the best interest of the work.,16
MULDER,"Well, what is this ""work"" that my father was involved in?",11
VICTOR KLEMPER,I have no answer for you.,6
MULDER,"Well, you knew him! Was he a murderer too?",9
VICTOR KLEMPER,There are some things you don't have to know.,9
MULDER,"No, I need to know! I need to know the truth! Isn't that what you want? For the truth to be known?",22
VICTOR KLEMPER,Do you know the formula of Napier's constant?,8
SCULLY,"Yes, why?",2
VICTOR KLEMPER,The photo was taken at the Strughold Mining Company in West Virginia and that is all I will tell you. The rest you can find out yourself.,27
MULDER,"Let's go, Scully.",3
AIDE,Hello?,1
AIDE,"Yes, one moment. It's for you, sir.",7
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Yes?,1
VICTOR KLEMPER,It's Klemper.,2
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Victor...,1
VICTOR KLEMPER,"How are you, old friend? It's been far too many years.",11
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"What is it, Victor?",4
VICTOR KLEMPER,"Oh, I was just paid a visit by the son of one of our old colleagues.",16
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"What did you tell him, Victor?",6
VICTOR KLEMPER,"I told him that you were the most venal man I've ever met. Beyond that, I told him nothing.",19
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Mulder is alive.,3
1ST ELDER,Then I think it's time we call our friends who will handle this matter more satisfactorily.,16
NURSE,Are you expecting any visitors?,5
MARGARET SCULLY,"Oh, is it Dana? Is Dana here?",7
NURSE,"No, it's a man. He says he was asked to come here.",12
ALBERT HOSTEEN,My name is Albert Hosteen. I was asked to come here and help with your daughter.,16
MARGARET SCULLY,There must be some mistake.,5
ALBERT HOSTEEN,Is your daughter the F.B.I. woman?,6
MARGARET SCULLY,Dana?,1
ALBERT HOSTEEN,Yes. She's very sorry she can't come here to comfort you.,11
MARGARET SCULLY,You know where she is? Is she okay?,8
ALBERT HOSTEEN,"Yes, I believe so. She is weak.",7
MARGARET SCULLY,"She's getting better. She has the best doctors, they're watching her around the clock.",14
ALBERT HOSTEEN,"If it's all right, I would like to pray over her here.",12
SCULLY,What do you think your father would have been doing here?,11
MULDER,I don't know. He never came home wearing a miner's cap.,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, take a look at this. What do you think?",10
MULDER,"I'd like to try door number one, Monty. I'm trying two-seven-eight-two-eight, it's not working.",14
SCULLY,It's not working here either.,5
MULDER,Sure that's the right number?,5
SCULLY,Positive. Napier's constant is the basis of all natural logarithms.,10
MULDER,"I think with a crowbar and a small nuclear device, I might be able to get through one of these things.",21
SCULLY,"Mulder... No, wait, hang on a second. Whatever we find in here... I don't think you've had time to process everything that you've been through.",25
MULDER,"I'm okay, Scully...",3
SCULLY,"You weren't even able to go to your father's funeral and if something in here were to cast doubt on the kind of man he was... I, I just know how it would affect me.",35
CSM,You called me.,3
SKINNER,"Yes, I did.",3
CSM,About?,1
SKINNER,I may have located the digital tape that you're looking for.,11
CSM,You may have located it?,5
SKINNER,"Yes, although there's a great chance it may fall into the hands of people who want to use it for purposes not your own.",24
CSM,You want to work a deal? Is that what this is? Let me tell you something. I don't work deals.,20
SKINNER,I just thought you should know of certain potentialities.,9
CSM,Do you have the tape?,5
SKINNER,"As I said, I may have located it.",8
CSM,Do you have the damn tape?!,6
SKINNER,I'll know more when we next meet.,7
CSM,I do not negotiate. Do you understand?,7
SKINNER,"Yes, sir.",2
CSM,I don't think you do. I don't think you understand at all.,12
SKINNER,"No, I'm quite aware of your policies in those regards.",10
CSM,Then I hope your next course of action will be more... cautious and informed.,14
SCULLY,"Mulder, look at this. It looks like their storing records.",10
MULDER,Of what?,2
SCULLY,"Of medical files, by the look of it. Got names... alphabetized.",11
MULDER,Lots of files.,3
SCULLY,Lots and lots of files.,5
MULDER,What's in these files?,4
SCULLY,"Standard medical forms. These are birth certificates, small pox vaccination certificate and then there's this.",15
MULDER,What is this?,3
SCULLY,"It's an old tissue collection cassette, the new ones are plastic.",11
MULDER,Do all these files contain the same materials?,8
SCULLY,"Yes, exactly.",2
MULDER,What year was this person born?,6
SCULLY,1955. All of these files are 1955.,7
MULDER,What year were you born?,5
SCULLY,"1964, why?",2
MULDER,Let's go find 1964.,4
SCULLY,You're looking for a file on me?,7
MULDER,"""Dana Katherine Scully.""",3
SCULLY,"What? That's a recent tissue sample. What the hell is going on here, Mulder?",14
MULDER,"I don't know, Scully.",4
SCULLY,That's your sister's file.,4
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,What are you looking for?,5
MULDER,I don't know.,3
"""SUBJECT NAME","MULDER, Samantha Ann",3
BIRTH DATE,"11/21/65 ID 378671"") Take a look at this, Scully.",9
"""SUBJECT NAME","MULDER, Fox William",3
BIRTH DATE,"10/13/61 ID 292544"") This file was originally mine.",8
SCULLY,I don't understand.,3
MULDER,"Wait here, Scully.",3
SCULLY,"Mulder, where are you going? Mulder? Mulder!",7
MAN #1,"Come on, let's go!",4
MAN #2,There!,1
MAN #3,Find the woman too.,4
MULDER,Scully!,1
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
MULDER,Scully!,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, I'm down here!",4
MULDER,"You okay, Scully?",3
SCULLY,I heard gunshots.,3
MULDER,I've been looking for you.,5
SCULLY,What happened to you?,4
MULDER,They got a small army outside. I think they got us trapped.,12
SCULLY,"I think there's a way out, down here.",8
SKINNER,This place isn't even on the map. How'd you get here?,11
MULDER,You'd be surprised what's not on the map in this country and what our government will do to keep it that way.,22
SKINNER,How's that?,2
MULDER,"Last night, we were chased by some kind of hit squad driving what looked an awful lot like C.I.A. fleet sedans.",21
SKINNER,"Well, I may be able to negotiate a deal that would guarantee your safety.",14
SCULLY,What kind of deal?,4
SKINNER,I'll turn over the digital tape in return for your reinstatement...,11
MULDER,"No, sir. I need that tape. I need those files.",10
SKINNER,I'm talking about a way to save your lives.,9
MULDER,And I'm talking about an elaborate conspiracy against the American public. Do you know what we found last night?,19
SKINNER,What?,1
SCULLY,An extremely elaborate filing system of medical records.,8
MULDER,Locked inside a mountain vault.,5
SKINNER,For the purpose of?,4
MULDER,"I don't know. But the answer's got to be on that tape, in those files.",15
SKINNER,Is that answer worth your lives?,6
MULDER,It's obviously worth killing us for.,6
SKINNER,"In your wildest dreams, what do you possibly hope to find, Agent Mulder?",13
MULDER,Why they killed my father... and what happened to my sister... and what they did to Agent Scully.,18
SCULLY,"I think we should let him make the deal, Mulder. Look... those answers mean nothing if we're going to be hunted down like animals. We are operating so far outside of the law right now, we've given up on the very notion of justice. We've turned ourselves into outsiders. We have lost our access and our protection.",57
MULDER,"What makes you think there's any such thing as justice, Scully?",11
SCULLY,"Then what good are those answers to anybody but you, Mulder?",11
MULDER,What we found last night...,5
SCULLY,"Look, I want exactly what you want. But I need to see my sister.",14
MULDER,I suppose you already tried to make a backup of the tape.,12
SKINNER,Whoever downloaded those files put a copy protector on them. I couldn't get a hard copy to print either.,19
MULDER,What makes you think they'll even honor this deal?,9
SKINNER,"Because, if they don't... I'll go state's evidence and testify... or they'll have to kill me too.",17
MULDER,"It's up to you, Scully.",5
SCULLY,I told Skinner to make the deal. But not to hand over the tape until you agree to it.,19
MULDER,"I'm sorry about your sister, Scully.",6
SCULLY,I just need to know if she's going to be okay.,11
ALBERT HOSTEEN,"For two days, I had prayed for the F.B.I. woman's sister. Her doctor said she was getting better and her mother, who would not leave her bedside, was able to sleep. But word had come from my brothers in the north that did not give me hope. The white buffalo calf had survived, but after a day, it would no longer drink its mother's milk. On the third day, the mother buffalo laid down in her stall and would not get up. They said the men could do nothing for her. That night, she died. My father taught me when I was a boy that this is how life is. That for something to live, another thing must often be sacrificed. This was my fear now for the young woman.",130
SKINNER,I'm here to see Melissa Scully. My name is Walter Skinner. I'm an assistant director at the F.B.I. I'm very sorry about your daughter. Dana asked me to come here to deliver a message.,34
MARGARET SCULLY,You've been in contact with her?,6
SKINNER,Yes.,1
MARGARET SCULLY,"Well, I want to know where she is and if she's okay.",12
SKINNER,"She's okay, but she's in a very serious situation which prevents her from being here.",15
MARGARET SCULLY,What kind of situation?,4
SKINNER,One that we hope to reverse so that Dana can come back to work.,14
ALBERT HOSTEEN,"That man you just saw, he's been very curious about this room.",12
SKINNER,Who are you?,3
ALBERT HOSTEEN,My name is Albert Hosteen. I was asked to come here.,11
SKINNER,"All right, Albert. Do not leave this room. Do you understand?",11
ALBERT HOSTEEN,Yes.,1
2ND MAN,I could use a beer. Do you want anything?,9
KRYCEK,No.,1
2ND MAN,You sure?,2
KRYCEK,Yeah.,1
AT THE CAR CLOCK AS IT BLINKS 12,"00. His face goes blank in realization and he runs out of the car as fast as he can. The car literally shoots a fireball into the air as it explodes, knocking Krycek off his feet from twenty yards. He looks back briefly and keeps running as the car continues to burn. Krycek's ex-cohorts watch him run, knowing that they failed their mission.)",63
MULDER,Mister Klemper? Mister Klemper?,4
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Hello again, young lady.",4
SCULLY,Where's Victor Klemper?,3
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Oh, poor Klemper. They found him yesterday, here among his flowers. Apparently, his heart had given out.",17
MULDER,"You killed him, didn't you? You're one of the men in this photo. You knew my father.",17
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Yes. Since we were young men.,6
MULDER,You were involved in this project. You know why the medical data was being collected.,15
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Yes, I do, indeed. In 1947, a spacecraft was reportedly recovered in New Mexico. No doubt you know of this and of the reported recovery of a body at the site. These incidents not only coincided with the end of World War II, but an ignominious project which brought Nazi scientists and war criminals to this country to exploit their knowledge.",61
SCULLY,Operation Paper Clip.,3
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"Yes, you know of it already. And you must also know the work of Doctor Joseph Mengele, the Nazi angel of death.",22
SCULLY,Mengele thought that he could produce a super-race through genetic engineering.,11
WELL-MANICURED MAN,As did many of his colleagues at the Institute of Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene.,15
SCULLY,Like Victor Klemper?,3
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Poor Victor. He loved his orchids. Did you know that he was able to create some of the most beautiful hybrids?,21
MULDER,Klemper was trying to create an alien-human hybrid. That's what I saw in the boxcar. He was using human test subjects.,21
SCULLY,"Mulder, wait.",2
MULDER,My father was involved in this?,6
SCULLY,"The technology wasn't there, Mulder. DNA wasn't even identified until 1944. This is all a lie.",16
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"When your father realized what the medical data was being used for, he objected strenuously.",15
MULDER,He collected those files?,4
WELL-MANICURED MAN,"With the threat of nuclear holocaust in the 1950s, the government instructed men like your father to gather genetic data on the general populous for the purpose of post-apocalyptic identification.",30
MULDER,The vaccination records. They took tissue from everyone who received a small pox inoculation.,14
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Hundreds of millions of Americans.,5
MULDER,So that Victor Klemper had access to a DNA database of nearly everyone who was born since 1950.,18
SCULLY,"Mulder, this man is telling you everything that you want to hear but it's a fabrication, it is pure science fiction. There were no experiments with aliens.",27
WELL-MANICURED MAN,Why would I lie to you?,6
SCULLY,"Like you said before, to protect yourself and the continuation of the Nazi agenda... human tests.",16
MULDER,"Why was your file there, Scully?",6
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MULDER,There were current records on file.,6
SCULLY,"Yes, but records of what, Mulder?",6
MULDER,Of abductions! Of abductees. They took my sister. Why?,9
WELL-MANICURED MAN,They took her as insurance because your father threatened to expose the project.,13
MULDER,Why her? Why not me?,5
WELL-MANICURED MAN,It's not for me to say but your life in danger now too. You also threaten to expose the project. You have become your father.,25
MULDER,Why are you telling me this?,6
WELL-MANICURED MAN,It's what you want to know... isn't it?,8
MULDER,Is there more?,3
WELL-MANICURED MAN,More than you'll ever know.,5
AIDE,Yes?,1
KRYCEK,Can I talk to him?,5
AIDE,"Yes, he's just arrived. One moment, please. You have a call, sir.",12
CSM,Thank you. Hello?,3
KRYCEK,I'm alive. Isn't that a surprise?,6
CSM,"Yes, good, good, good. Uh, where are you?",8
KRYCEK,"Somewhere that you will never find me, you double-crossing son of a bitch.",13
CSM,Are you sure?,3
KRYCEK,"I'm sure of this... if I so much as feel your presence, I'm going to make you a very, very famous man. You understand?",24
CSM,"Yes, thank you. I'm going to report that to the group. I've just received confirmation that the digital tape containing the stolen files was destroyed in the carbomb explosion, which killed Agent Scully's would-be assassin.",35
1ST ELDER,What about Mulder and Scully?,5
CSM,"I have a meeting with the F.B.I., they, uh... they want to make a deal.",15
1ST ELDER,For what?,2
CSM,For nothing. There'll be no deal. There's no deal to make.,11
MRS. MULDER,Fox?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MRS. MULDER,What time is it?,4
MULDER,It's after two.,3
MRS. MULDER,"What, did you drive up here? Why didn't you call?",10
MULDER,I needed to see you in person. I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about something that happened a long time ago.,26
MRS. MULDER,"Oh, Fox... I don't remember anything, I told you before.",10
MULDER,"Mom, listen to me. When Samantha... before she was gone, did Dad ever ask you if you had a favorite? Did he ever ask you that?",26
MRS. MULDER,"Fox, please...",2
MULDER,"Mom, did he ever ask you to make a choice?",10
MRS. MULDER,Don't do this...,3
MULDER,"Mom, listen to me! I need to know! Did he make you make a choice?",15
MRS. MULDER,"No. I couldn't choose. It was your father's choice and I hated him for it. Even in his grave, I hate him still.",23
CSM,"Now, you wanted to see me?",6
SKINNER,I have the tape you've been looking for.,8
CSM,Really?,1
SKINNER,I'm prepared to hand it over or destroy it in exchange for Mulder and Scully's safety and for their reinstatement here.,21
CSM,"What did I tell you, Mister Skinner? I don't negotiate. Especially not with punks like you who think they can bluff me.",22
SKINNER,Bluff you?,2
CSM,"You haven't got any tape. You haven't got any deal. You can't play poker if you don't have any cards, Mister Skinner. You ever wonder what it would be like to, uh... die in a plane crash? Of botulism? Even a heart attack's not uncommon for a man your age. You think I'm bluffing?",54
SKINNER,I'm not finished yet. Albert?,5
ALBERT HOSTEEN,Yat a valgala.,3
CSM,What is this?,3
SKINNER,This is where you pucker up and kiss my ass.,10
CSM,"Now, listen, you...",3
SKINNER,"Now, you listen to me, you son of a bitch! This man's name is Albert Hosteen. You should remember that. Because if Agents Mulder and Scully come down with so much as a case of the flu, Albert is prepared to recite, chapter and verse, file for file, everything on your precious tape.",53
CSM,"It's a nice try, Skinner.",5
SKINNER,"I'm sure you're thinking Albert is an old man and there are plenty of ways you might kill him too. Which is why, in the ancient oral tradition of his people, he's told twenty other men the information on those files. So unless you kill every Navajo living in four states... that information is available with a simple phone call. Welcome to the wonderful world of high technology.",68
CSM,You're bluffing.,2
SKINNER,Am I?,2
SCULLY,"It happened three hours ago. She went into surgery and, uh... the damage to her brain was worse than they had hoped. Her blood pressure started to rise and, uh... she slipped away. She died for me and I tried to tell her I was sorry but I don't think she'll ever really know.",54
MULDER,"Oh, she knows. Melissa knows.",5
SCULLY,You were right. There is no justice.,7
MULDER,"I don't think this is about justice, Scully.",8
SCULLY,Then what is it about?,5
MULDER,"I think it's about something we have no personal choice in. I think it's about fate. Skinner told me that he talked to you, that you were insistent about coming back to work. Now, if Melissa's death is...",38
SCULLY,I need something to put my back up against.,9
MULDER,I feel the same way. We've both lost so much... but I believe that what we're looking for is in the X-Files. I'm more certain than ever that the truth is in there.,33
SCULLY,"I've heard the truth, Mulder. Now what I want are the answers.",12
