SCULLY,"Time passes in moments... moments which, rushing past define the path of a life just as surely as they lead towards its end. How rarely do we stop to examine that path, to see the reasons why all things happen, to consider whether the path we take in life is our own making or simply one into which we drift with eyes closed.",63
SCULLY,"But what if we could stop, pause to take stock of each precious moment before it passes? Might we then see the endless forks in the road that have shaped a life? And, seeing those choices, choose another path?",39
MUSIC,"""See, the storm has broken in the middle of the night nothing left here for me, it's washed away the rain pushes the buildings aside... """,25
SCULLY,I got the lab to rush the results of...,9
SCULLY,"I said, I got the lab to rush the results of the Szczesny autopsy, if you're interested.",17
MULDER,"I heard you, Scully.",4
SCULLY,And Szczesny did indeed drown but not as the result of the inhalation of ectoplasm as you so vehemently suggested.,20
MULDER,"Well, what else could she possibly have drowned in?",9
SCULLY,"Margarita mix, upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado Gold tequila which, as it turns out she and her friends rapidly consumed in the woods while trying to reenact the Blair Witch Project.",33
MULDER,"Well, I think that demands a little deeper investigation, don't you?",11
SCULLY,"No, I don't.",3
MULDER,"Well, it doesn't matter. We got bigger fish to fry.",10
MULDER,"Have a seat, Scully. Check this out. Is that beautiful or what?",12
SCULLY,"Crop circles, Mulder?",3
MULDER,Computer-generated crop circles. It's a fractal image predicted by a computer program and using data of every known occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 years.,27
MULDER,"What most people don't realize is that, since 1991...",9
MULDER,... there's been a dramatic increase in size and complexity of circle design. That's when the Mandelbrot Set appeared in England.,20
MULDER,A series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost impossibly overnight in a field near Cambridge.,15
MULDER,"But that was merely prelude of what was to come. Three years later, in 1994 even more complex formations occurred simultaneously on opposite ends of the English countryside with the Mandelbrot Set, were it still there, at its center. Then, in 1997, even more complex formations occurred...",47
MULDER,... and I'm not wearing any pants right now.,8
SCULLY,Hmm?,1
MULDER,You're not listening.,3
SCULLY,I am.,2
SCULLY,I guess I just don't see the point.,8
MULDER,"The point is is that a computer program has shown us that these are not just random, happenstance coincidental occurrences and that same program has predicted that in just 48 hours even more complex formations are going to be laid down in a field near Avebury-- 48 hours, Scully-- but I wouldn't mind getting there earlier if you don't mind.",60
SCULLY,Getting where?,2
MULDER,England - I got two tickets on a 5:30 flight.,9
SCULLY,"Mulder, I still have to go over to the hospital and-and-and finish the final paperwork on the autopsy you had me do. And, to be honest, it's Saturday and I wouldn't mind, I don't know, taking a bath?",38
MULDER,"Well, what the hell does that mean?",7
SCULLY,"What it means, Mulder, is I'm not interested in tracking down some sneaky farmers who happened to ace geometry in high school.",22
SCULLY,"And besides, I mean... what could you possibly get out of this? Or learn? I mean, it's not even remotely FBI-related.",21
MULDER,I'll just cancel your ticket.,5
MULDER,Thanks for lunch.,3
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,"Look, we're always running. We're always chasing the next big thing. Why don't you ever just stay still?",18
MULDER,I wouldn't know what I'd be missing.,7
SCULLY,"My name is Dana Scully and I was told I could pick up a postmortem folder for a Ms. Szczesny here. It's, uh, for the FBI.",26
NURSE 2,Let's see...,2
NURSE 2,Oh!,1
NURSE 2,"You just sign here, please.",5
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,"Hi, um... I was given the wrong test results. This, uh, x-ray marked ""D. Waterston"" was in the envelope marked ""Szczesny."" I was expecting autopsy results.",26
NURSE 2,"Oh, I'm sorry. They must've gotten switched. Sorry for the inconvenience.",11
SCULLY,"Thank you. Is the, um... is the ""D. Waterston"" that was on the x-ray is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?",20
NURSE,"Let's see: Waterston, Waterston... Yes, it is. Admitted yesterday, coronary care unit, room 306.",14
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
DR. KOPEIKAN,"I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. Everything appears to be as it should under the circumstances so don't worry. If you'd like, I can show you the hospital cafeteria.",32
MAGGIE WATERSTON,"Uh, yeah, I guess... Yeah, okay.",6
MAGGIE WATERSTON,"Are there phones down there, too? I need to make some phone calls.",13
DR. KOPEIKAN,Yes.,1
DR. KOPEIKAN,Excuse me...,2
DR. KOPEIKAN,Can I help you with something?,6
SCULLY,"Um, I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Scully. I-I was just in the hospital and...",13
DR. KOPEIKAN,Can we step into the hallway?,6
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
DR. KOPEIKAN,"I'm Dr. Waterston's cardiologist, Paul Kopeikan. Did you say your name was Scully?",13
SCULLY,"Uh, yes, Dana Scully.",4
DR. KOPEIKAN,Dr. Waterston's mentioned you.,4
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.",6
DR. KOPEIKAN,"No, you were a student of his, right?",8
SCULLY,He has a heart condition?,5
DR. KOPEIKAN,"Dr. Waterston came in yesterday with severe chest pains and he ordered us to do an echocardiogram and a biopsy because he'd had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection the week before. Fortunately, it was the right call.",38
SCULLY,Then it's serious.,3
DR. KOPEIKAN,"But treatable. I have to wake him up soon, if you'd care to...",13
SCULLY,"No, that's all right. But, uh, thanks for your time.",10
DR. KOPEIKAN,He must've been a wonderful teacher. I've been following his work on constrictive pericarditis for years now.,17
SCULLY,Yes... he's a remarkable man.,5
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MAGGIE WATERSTON,You came to see him.,5
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, who is this?",5
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Margaret Waterston.,2
SCULLY,Maggie. Is everything all right?,5
MAGGIE WATERSTON,"Well, that depends, doesn't it?",5
SCULLY,I'm sorry?,2
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Whatever. Dr. Kopeikan told my father you were here and now he wants to see you.,16
SCULLY,About what?,2
MAGGIE WATERSTON,"Look, he asked me to call, so I'm calling.",9
SCULLY,"I don't know, Maggie. I don't know if I've got time.",11
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Don't know if you have the time.,7
SCULLY,"Maggie, can you hang on a second? I have another call coming through.",13
MAGGIE WATERSTON,"Listen... it's your choice, but if you come it doesn't mean I accept you being in his life.",18
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MAN ON OLD BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE ON TV,I'll never see you again.,5
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MAN ON OLD TV MOVIE,You're breaking my heart.,4
MULDER,"Hey, you're there?",3
MULDER,Hey.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, aren't you supposed to be on a plane?",9
MULDER,"I got a 5:30 flight, remember?",6
SCULLY,Right. Guess I lost track of time.,7
MULDER,"Listen, uh, the reason I called-- am I catching you at a bad time?",14
SCULLY,"No, I just walked in. Why?",6
MULDER,"Uh, there's this group in D.C. that is researching crop circles. They've got a totally different set of coordinates from the one that I got already.",26
SCULLY,"Mulder, I'm not going.",4
MULDER,"I got to ask you a favor. One of the researchers lives out near the hospital and they've got these sensitive photos and data and stuff that they won't fax to me so I was just wondering if you would just, maybe go over there and, you know, and get it and put it in the bureau pouch for me...",60
MULDER,"Speak to me, Scully.",4
SCULLY,"I'm out for the evening, Mulder.",6
MULDER,"Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?",11
SCULLY,"Look, um... why don't you leave that address on my answering machine and, uh, I'll try for you.",18
SCULLY,I'm sorry. I-I have the wrong room.,7
RED-HAIRED WOMAN,It's okay.,2
SCULLY,Hi.,1
DANIEL WATERSTON,So I have to lock eyes with the Devil for you to grace me with your presence?,17
SCULLY,Surely not the Devil.,4
SCULLY,"How are you feeling, Daniel?",5
DANIEL WATERSTON,It's a real drag when the body doesn't want to play anymore.,12
SCULLY,You're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis.,7
DANIEL WATERSTON,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Dana. It's what doctors do everyday. You may have forgotten that.",18
SCULLY,Daniel...,1
SCULLY,"So, how did you happen to be here in Washington?",10
DANIEL WATERSTON,That's a long story.,4
DANIEL WATERSTON,How's the FBI?,3
SCULLY,Is that why you wanted to see me? To remind me once again what a bad choice I made?,19
DANIEL WATERSTON,Believe me. My motivation is far more selfish than that.,10
SCULLY,"You scare me, Daniel.",4
DANIEL WATERSTON,I know. I scare you...... because I represent that which is ingrained not only in your mind but in your heart-- that which you secretly long for.,27
SCULLY,You never accepted my reason for leaving.,7
DANIEL WATERSTON,"It wasn't a reason, it was an excuse.",8
SCULLY,But you understood why.,4
DANIEL WATERSTON,I can't believe the FBI is a passion. Not like medicine.,11
SCULLY,I'm sorry I came.,4
SCULLY,I just wanted to make sure you were okay.,9
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I know how difficult it must have been for you... just walking through that door but you wouldn't have come if you didn't want to and that says something, doesn't it?",31
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"I was just about to leave you a message. Listen, I got that, uh, that address that I wanted you to go to for me. It's a woman you're going to be dealing with. She's affiliated with The American Taoist Healing Center.",42
SCULLY,She researches crop circles?,4
MULDER,"Don't roll your eyes, Scully.",5
SCULLY,Mulder you want me to...?,5
MULDER,"Scully? Scully, you there?",4
SCULLY,Hi. I'm...,2
SCULLY,You were...,2
WOMAN,... at the hospital today.,4
SCULLY,"Right. That's strange. Um, I-I'm Agent Scully. I'm-I'm here on behalf of my partner.",14
WOMAN,About my research.,3
SCULLY,"For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.",9
WOMAN,Right. I'm Colleen Azar. Would you like to come in?,10
SCULLY,"No, thank you. I think I need some fresh air.",10
COLLEEN AZAR,Are you all right?,4
SCULLY,"Yes, I... I mean, yes, I-I'm just a little shaken. I... a near car accident, I think. It's nothing, really.",20
COLLEEN AZAR,"A car accident isn't ""nothing.""",5
SCULLY,I'm sorry?,2
COLLEEN AZAR,In my experience they're often the end results of us not paying attention to something.,15
SCULLY,"Look, I-I don't mean to be rude but I really don't have much time.",14
COLLEEN AZAR,Sure. I'll go get my papers.,6
COLLEEN AZAR,"You think what we do is a little ridiculous, don't you?",11
SCULLY,"Uh, to be honest, I don't know exactly what it is that you do.",14
COLLEEN AZAR,But you've already formed a judgment about it.,8
SCULLY,I really should be going.,5
COLLEEN AZAR,There is a greater intelligence in all things. Accidents-- or near accidents-- often remind us that we need to keep our mind open to the lessons it gives.,28
COLLEEN AZAR,You may want to slow down.,6
SCULLY,Hello.,1
DANIEL WATERSTON,"Aw, Hurricane Scully has arrived.",5
SCULLY,I was summoned.,3
DANIEL WATERSTON,Would you please tell the doc here why he should listen to me.,13
DR. KOPEIKAN,"Sir, we've already agreed to doses of digoxin that are far beyond what I normally recommend.",16
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I guarantee you, Doctor, you're doing it right.",8
DR. KOPEIKAN,But I can't be responsible for treatment that might exacerbate your illness. There hasn't even been a double-blind analysis of prednisone's effect.,22
SCULLY,Prednisone? That won't complicate cardiac arrhythmia. Not if it's just a short burst.,13
DANIEL WATERSTON,There. An informed opinion.,4
MAGGIE WATERSTON,You come off so rational but maybe you know less than you think.,13
DANIEL WATERSTON,She's... been through some difficult times and she's very angry.,10
SCULLY,How did she even find out?,6
DANIEL WATERSTON,There are things you don't know... things I'm not proud of.,11
SCULLY,What things?,2
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I screwed up, Dana. Things got bad at home after...",10
SCULLY,Bad how?,2
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I haven't been completely honest with you. It was hard for me... when you walked away. Shut down from my family and needless to say, it was very difficult for Barbara.",31
SCULLY,You divorced.,2
DANIEL WATERSTON,Only after an interminable period of discomfort for us both.,10
SCULLY,Where did you go?,4
DANIEL WATERSTON,Here. Washington.,2
SCULLY,When?,1
DANIEL WATERSTON,Almost ten years ago.,4
SCULLY,Daniel... you didn't move here for me?,7
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I didn't mean for it to happen this way, of course.",11
SCULLY,"Oh, God.",2
SCULLY,You've come at such a strange time.,7
DANIEL WATERSTON,"I know, I know. You-you have a life.",8
SCULLY,I don't know what I have. I mean... your x-rays were in the wrong envelope. I never would have even known you were here if it wasn't for a mix-up. It's just...,32
DANIEL WATERSTON,"What do you want, Dana?",5
SCULLY,I want everything I should want at this time of my life. Maybe I want the life I didn't choose.,20
SCULLY,Nurse! We have a code in here! Nurse!,8
INTERCOM VOICE,"Code blue, C.C.U.",3
SCULLY,"He's in v-fib, get his head.",6
SCULLY,In!,1
NURSE,In.,1
SCULLY,200 joules. All clear?,4
NURSE,Clear.,1
NURSE,"No pulse, no resp.",4
SCULLY,300 joules.,2
NURSE 3,300 charge.,2
SCULLY,Clear!,1
NURSE,Clear.,1
NURSE,"No pulse, no resp.",4
SCULLY,"Epinephrine, one milligram, I.V. Push. Now! Who's paying attention?!",9
NURSE 3,Ready.,1
SCULLY,Clear!,1
NURSES,Clear.,1
SCULLY,We have a pulse.,4
SCULLY,Okay. Thank you.,3
CAROL,"Hi, can I help you?",5
SCULLY,"Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.",5
CAROL,You want to come in?,5
SCULLY,I just need to speak with her that's all.,9
CAROL,I have to go. Call me if anything interesting happens.,10
COLLEEN AZAR,Okay. Bye.,2
COLLEEN AZAR,I'm surprised to see you again.,6
SCULLY,"I'm sorry that I was rude before. I'm a medical doctor and a scientist and, you're right, I don't know what it is that you do... but there was something that you said that I wanted to ask you about.",40
COLLEEN AZAR,About slowing down? Would you like to sit down? Please.,10
SCULLY,"I have a friend who's ill, and, um... I had a strange feeling today-- just a short while ago, actually-- that he may be dying from a more serious condition than anyone realizes.",33
COLLEEN AZAR,"You sense something? Holistic practitioners believe, as do many eastern religions, that living beings exist beyond the physical dimensions of time and space that we're composed of layers of energy and consciousness. You've probably heard it referred to as an ""aura.""",41
SCULLY,Hmm... Yes.,2
COLLEEN AZAR,Witness this energy field and truths come out that have little to do with scientific proof and much to do with faith.,22
SCULLY,What are you saying that I saw?,7
COLLEEN AZAR,"Pain. And where there's pain there's a need for healing-- physically, mentally or spiritually.",14
SCULLY,But he has a heart condition.,6
COLLEEN AZAR,"When we hold onto shame and guilt and fear it creates imbalance, makes us forget who we are.",18
COLLEEN AZAR,This is difficult for you to accept.,7
COLLEEN AZAR,Would you like to have some tea?,7
COLLEEN AZAR,Have you ever had moments when everything gets incredibly clear? When time seems to expand?,15
SCULLY,Yes. It's so strange.,4
COLLEEN AZAR,You may be more open to things than you think. It's just a matter of what you do with it.,20
COLLEEN AZAR,"I used to be a physicist. I was successful in my field working 80-odd hours a week. I thought I was happy. Truth is, I was cut off from the world and from myself. I was literally dying inside. I was in a relationship with Carol, who you met but I was so afraid of what the world and my family and my fellow scientists would think that I told no one. Then, two years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer.",82
SCULLY,I'm sorry.,2
COLLEEN AZAR,Mmm... Don't be. It's the cancer that got my attention. It stopped me from being on the self-destructive path I was on. It made me realize I was in a field that had little meaning for me and it's what's allowed me to be happy for what feels like the first time in my life.,55
SCULLY,But how?,2
COLLEEN AZAR,I was introduced to a healer who helped me see the disease for what it was. It wasn't until I began releasing shame and telling the truth that my cancer went into remission.,33
COLLEEN AZAR,You still aren't sure. You came here looking for answers and you want something to take back with you. Everything happens for a reason.,24
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Are you happy?,3
SCULLY,I'm sorry? I was just going up to see your father.,11
MAGGIE WATERSTON,You can't. He's in a coma.,6
SCULLY,Since when?,2
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Since about two minutes after you supposedly saved his life.,10
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Do you have any idea the hell you created in our lives?,12
SCULLY,"Maggie, to be honest, I left so that there wouldn't be hell in your lives.",15
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Don't try to be reasonable with me. I am so sick of being reasonable. You moved on but we've had to live with what you left behind.,27
HEALER,What I try to do is clear the body's energy channels-- what we call Chakras-- which can become barriers to a doctor's ability to effectively heal the patient. When these channels are working improperly-- whether from poor physical or emotional health-- the block serves to create conditions for disease. If I can unblock the energy early on then I can prevent the onset or escalation of an illness or provide a place...,72
DR. KOPEIKAN,"What's going on here? Dr. Scully, who do you think you are?",12
SCULLY,We have nothing but Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.,10
DR. KOPEIKAN,You're not his doctor.,4
SCULLY,I understand that. What's taking place here is an alternative approach.,11
DR. KOPEIKAN,"What's taking place here is a waste of time, Dr. Scully, and I think that Dr. Waterston would be the first to agree with me. Have you considered that?",29
SCULLY,I just wanted to help him. It seemed like nothing else was working.,13
DR. KOPEIKAN,With all due respect that is not for you to assess. That is for me or Dr. Waterston's family to decide.,21
MAGGIE WATERSTON,Then let him continue. If it isn't hurting him we should at least be open to it.,17
HEALER,"I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can do at this time. This man, quite frankly, is ready to move on. But something seems to be holding him back. Unfinished business is binding him to the physical plane-- something he needs to release before he can let go.",48
MUSIC,"Broken heart pushing us hear the rain fall See the wind come to my eyes See the storm broken now I'm nothing Speak to me, baby in the middle of the night...",32
MUSIC,Speak to me...,3
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MAGGIE WATERSTON,It's Maggie. I need you to come to the hospital right away.,12
SCULLY,"Maggie, what's...?",2
SCULLY,Daniel?,1
DANIEL WATERSTON,You think I'd give up so easily?,7
SCULLY,You were slipping away. No one thought you'd come out of this. I'm still in shock.,16
DANIEL WATERSTON,Imagine my shock when my doctor told me the voodoo ritual you'd arranged for last night.,16
SCULLY,I was afraid it didn't work.,6
DANIEL WATERSTON,Of course it didn't work. Don't be absurd. Where do you get this crap?,14
SCULLY,"Daniel, that ""crap"" may have just saved your life whether you're open to it or not.",16
DANIEL WATERSTON,It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about that. Look at me. I'm going to get well... and we need to talk about... what happens next for us.,29
SCULLY,"I spoke at length to Maggie. It's time... that you took responsibility for the hurt you caused in your family. It's no accident that you got sick, Daniel. You've been running from the truth for ten years.",37
DANIEL WATERSTON,Dana... It was only to be with you. You were all I lived for.,14
SCULLY,Maybe the reason you're alive now is to make up for that. To make it up to Maggie.,18
DANIEL WATERSTON,"That's Maggie talking, not you.",5
SCULLY,"No. I'm not the same person, Daniel. I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't seen you again.",18
SCULLY,Excuse me!,2
MULDER,Hey.,1
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,I was just looking for you.,6
SCULLY,But you're supposed to be in England.,7
MULDER,I'm back.,2
SCULLY,What happened?,2
MULDER,Nothing. There was no event. No crop circles. Big waste of time.,12
SCULLY,"Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason, Mulder.",8
MULDER,What is that supposed to mean?,6
SCULLY,"Nothing. Come on, I'm make you some tea.",8
MULDER,I just find it hard to believe.,7
SCULLY,What part?,2
MULDER,The part where I go away for two days and your whole life changes.,14
SCULLY,"Mmm, I didn't say my whole life changed.",8
MULDER,You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple. God speaking back.,11
SCULLY,"Mmm, and I didn't say that God spoke back. I said that I had some kind of a vision.",19
MULDER,"Well, for you, that's like saying you're having David Crosby's baby.",11
MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,I once considered spending my whole life with this man. What I would have missed.,15
MULDER,"I don't think you can know. I mean, how many different lives would we be leading if we made different choices. We... We don't know.",25
SCULLY,What if there was only one choice and all the other ones were wrong? And there were signs along the way to pay attention to.,25
MULDER,"Mmm. And all the... choices would then lead to this very moment. One wrong turn, and... we wouldn't be sitting here together. Well, that says a lot. That says a lot, a lot, a lot. That's probably more than we should be getting into at this late hour.",48
