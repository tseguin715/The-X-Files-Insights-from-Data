(CUT BACK,"In the car. CARL WORMUS is slowing the car down because of the rising bridge. SHANNON MCMAHON slowly puts her left hand down on the CARL WORMUS's right leg. He smiles, as she does it.

CHRIS CARTER,Last season on The X-Files...,5
KNOWLE ROHRER,There was a rumoured program out of the cold war. A plan to create a super-soldier.,16
DOGGETT,I didn't want to believe it. He said Agent Scully's a part of that program too.,16
KRYCEK,Your baby was a miracle.,5
SCULLY,My baby is normal.,4
KRYCEK,She may never even make it out of this building.,10
SKINNER,Get him off!,3
SCULLY,This is my baby! Please don't let them take it!,10
REYES,"Push, Dana!",2
DOGGETT,This office is under investigation. For the late-night meeting between you and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer.,18
KERSH,You investigate what I tell you.,6
DOGGETT,You put me on the X-Files.,6
MULDER,I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know.,13
SCULLY,"It's going to be okay... She pats him on his back and walks with him into the living room, gently holding him in her arms. On the living room floor we see several packed suitcases.)",35
REYES,Hello?,1
MAN ON PHONE,"Monica, it's me. Did I wake you?",7
REYES,"Brad. Um-hmm, no, I'm awake.",5
FOLLMER,You're in town?,3

(CUT BACK,to REYES. Camera pans around her face.),7
REYES,Yeah. Sure. I can do that.,6
FOLLMER,Good. Looking forward to it.,5

TV ANNOUNCER,"... last night. The 38 year old body of Carl Wormus, a deputy administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency was pulled from the Potomac by divers this morning...",27

FOLLMER,Monica?,1
REYES,Hi.,1
FOLLMER,What you doing?,3

FOLLMER,Come on in.,3
FOLLMER,What?,1
REYES,We're at work.,3
FOLLMER,You used to ask me to close the door at work back in New York.,15
REYES,"Is that all you called me here for, Assistant Director?",10
FOLLMER,"I probably shouldn't tell you how hot you look either, because you do. How long's it been? Two years?",19
REYES,"Yeah. We should catch up, Brad. Really. I've got to get downstairs.",12
FOLLMER,I've got something for you.,5
FOLLMER,"Forgive me, but... uh... it didn't take a whole lot of digging to figure out why you're here in D.C., Monica.",21
REYES,What are those?,3
FOLLMER,Something you're gonna see... but I wanted to show you first. They were taken from security cameras in the FBI parking garage. One of them... shows you arriving in a cab meeting with John Doggett.,35
REYES,"Yeah, I'm working with him. He called me up here on a case.",13
FOLLMER,"I heard. Believe me, this whole thing about a chase and a crash and a fire. And now Doggett's internal investigation of Deputy Director Kersh... it's... big news.",28
REYES,What's so important to show me?,6
REYES,What's on the other tape?,5
KERSH,"How's your investigation going, John? Have you turned up any incriminating evidence on me yet?",15
DOGGETT,"It's only Monday morning, sir. It's nothing personal, Deputy Director. I hope you know that.",15
KERSH,"I know, John. I think we've pretty much always seen eye to eye. I'm sure if you can't find anything on me, John, nobody can.",25
REYES,Hi. How you doing?,4
REYES,That good?,2
DOGGETT,I didn't ask to be put down on the X- Files. Deputy Director Kersh put me down here. I'm just doing my job. What did they think? That I'd be thankful? That I'd do anything less?,36
REYES,"It's not gonna be easy, John.",6
DOGGETT,"Hell no it isn't. I'm going after the Deputy Director, the one man removed from the head of the FBI.",20
REYES,"No, I mean it may be impossible.",7
DOGGETT,What's this?,2
REYES,A security tape two nights ago from the FBI garage. You're not on it.,14
DOGGETT,What are you talking about?,5
DOGGETT,No. This is the wrong damn tape.,7
REYES,I've been backwards and forwards on it. There's nothing there.,10
DOGGETT,We were chased. AD Skinner and I were attacked and chased. This man Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the garage wall and it blew up in a ball of flames.,31
REYES,Not on this tape.,4
DOGGETT,Where'd you get this?,4
REYES,From someone who wanted to give me a heads-up.,9
DOGGETT,"They can't just make this all go away. There's evidence down in that parking garage, there were victims.",18
REYES,"I went down to that garage, John. Whatever happened, they've had 48 hours now to clean it up.",18
DOGGETT,There were witnesses.,3
REYES,Witnesses who are gonna stand up to this tape?,9

OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE,Naval telecommunications command.,3

OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE,Sir?...,1
OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE,Sir?...,1
SCULLY,What? What's the matter?,4
DOGGETT,What's the matter? I've been trying to call you.,9
SCULLY,"Yeah, the phone's off the hook because of the baby.",10
DOGGETT,"I got panicked that you're not going to be here, that you left, too.",14
SCULLY,Come in.,2
DOGGETT,I've been looking for Mulder. I went to his apartment.,10
SCULLY,I know.,2
DOGGETT,Where'd he go?,3
DOGGETT,Dana... where'd he go?,4
SCULLY,He's gone.,2
SCULLY,He's just... gone.,3
SKINNER,I don't know where Mulder is. I don't know that I'd tell you if I did.,16
REYES,"I checked with movers, airlines, car rental agencies... no Mulder.",10
DOGGETT,"Somebody get to him, that it? That doesn't seem possible, does it? Okay, so where does that leave us? Just me and you, our word against Kersh and the FBI.",30
REYES,"You'd better sit down, John. It's more complicated than that.",10
DOGGETT,What's more complicated?,3
REYES,This investigation.,2
DOGGETT,What about it?,3
SKINNER,I wanna ask you to drop it.,7
DOGGETT,"No, not from you. Not from you. Not, not after what we've been through. I mean, we barely escaped with our lives.",22
SKINNER,That's something worth thinking about.,5
DOGGETT,"I'm sorry, you're not that reasonable. What, did they get to you too?",13
SKINNER,"No one got to me, John, they didn't have to, that's the point.",13
DOGGETT,You're afraid of them.,4
SKINNER,I'm not afraid of them.,5
DOGGETT,"Well, you're afraid of something. What? The real tape showing up, them calling you a killer for you having to shoot Alex Krycek?",23
SKINNER,"No, I'll stand by my actions, Agent Doggett, but I won't stand by yours if you're gonna continue to push and push until you get somebody killed. You wanna know what I fear? I fear for Mulder and Scully. I fear for the life of that child if you don't stop pushing it, John.",54
DOGGETT,"You don't think I fear for those things, same as you?",11
SKINNER,"If you did, you'd let it go.",7
DOGGETT,"So what I'm hearing is... if I don't drop it, I'm alone on this.",14
REYES,John.,1
REYES,You're not.,2
FOLLMER,Hi. I hope it wasn't too presumptuous of me. I've ordered you a Martini.,14
REYES,"No, the presumption's all mine. Anyway, I called and asked you out, didn't I?",14
FOLLMER,"You, uh, actually a little confused me this morning in my office. I had this crazy notion that you're avoiding me.",21
REYES,Maybe I was trying to avoid myself.,7
REYES,"And those tapes you pulled out of your desk drawer weren't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee now, were they?",19
FOLLMER,I'd heard that you and John Doggett are tight.,9
REYES,You make it sound like I go home from work with Post-Its on my ass. It's nothing like that.,19
FOLLMER,Then I don't get it. Why risk your name and your career getting caught up in this... rabid investigation of his?,21
REYES,There isn't going to be an investigation. Not anymore.,9
FOLLMER,I wouldn't have thought Agent Doggett would be thrown off so easy. Not what I've heard about him.,18
REYES,"Whatever you may think about him, Brad, he's not a fool, you know.",13
FOLLMER,Now you're pissed off at me.,6
REYES,"No, I'm pissed off because this means I'll be shipping back to the New Orleans field office.",17
FOLLMER,What are you talking about? The way I heard it you're with the X-Files?,14
REYES,"If this investigation drops, they're gonna drop the X-Files right along with it. You know me, where my interests lie, this was my dream assignment. Not to mention how excited I was to be appointed here in D.C.",38
FOLLMER,But you just got here.,5
REYES,"Yeah, I know.",3
DOGGETT,"I'm really sorry. I... Dana, I need your help.",9
SCULLY,I don't know how to find him.,7
DOGGETT,"It just doesn't make any sense. Mulder leaving you here all alone, just walking out on you, not telling you where and why.",23
SCULLY,It makes sense in its own way. That's all I can tell you.,13
DOGGETT,Then tell me why you can't trust me. Everything I did to try and protect you when you thought your baby was in danger. What changed? Why is it suddenly I'm now the enemy?,34
SCULLY,"Let it go, John. Drop it. Please.",7
DOGGETT,"These people tried to kill me. They tried to kill AD Skinner. They wanted to kill Mulder, too. They're still out there, Dana.",23
SCULLY,"Exactly right, and they are unstoppable, and they are inside the FBI.",12
DOGGETT,"You know something you're not telling me. Mulder knows something. How long can you hide it from me? Knowle Rohrer, this old military buddy of mine. He told me your pregnancy was a result of a Government cloning experiment to try to create what he called a Super Soldier.",49
SCULLY,"I don't want to hear this. Look, there is nothing to any of this.",14
DOGGETT,"Knowle Rohrer, my buddy, was one of the men that tried to kill us in the FBI garage.",18
SCULLY,My baby... my son... is fine.,6
DOGGETT,I hope to God that's true. I just don't want to pretend.,12
SCULLY,I'm going to ask you to leave.,7
SCULLY,I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here.,12
OPERATOR'S VOICE,"Directory assistance, may I help you?",6
DOGGETT,"Let's try Maryland, Virginia.",4
OPERATOR'S VOICE,What district?,2
DOGGETT,Number for a Ryan Bracker. B-R-A-C-K-E-R.,6
DOGGETT,"Yeah hi, I was given this number for a Roger Erickson, formerly with the US Marine Corps.",17
DOGGETT,"Roger, hey, it's John Doggett, Bravo Company.",7
VOICE ON PHONE,How you doing?,3
DOGGETT,"Eh, I'm good. It's good to hear you. Listen, you remember Knowle Rohrer? What's the story with him? Didn't he get involved with something when he got back Stateside.",29
DOGGETT,"Yeah, let's get you a beer sometime.",7
VOICE OF SHANNON MCMAHON,This is Shannon. Leave a message and I'll return your call...,11
DOGGETT,"Yeah, hi, this is John Doggett. I'm trying to reach Shannon McMahon who was with Bravo Company U.S.M.C. If this is she can you please contact me to the FBI in Washington, D.C. as soon as possible?",37
SCULLY,"Sleepy time, sweet William. See you in a couple of hours.",11
REYES,Uh...,1
REYES,Hello?,1
REYES,Monica Reyes.,2
SCULLY,"It's, er, Scully.",3
REYES,"Dana, are you all right?",5
SCULLY,Is Agent Doggett there?,4
DOGGETT,Dana. Something wrong?,3
SCULLY,"Yeah. Yeah, something. Um, I think I might have been wrong, telling you to drop your investigation.",17
DOGGETT,"Well, I didn't drop it. As a matter of fact, we found something that sure as hell fits with what we are working on.",24
SCULLY,What is it?,3
DOGGETT,A body.,2
DOGGETT,Thanks for coming.,3
DOGGETT,The deceased's name is Carl Wormus. Deputy Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.,13
REYES,Drove though a barricade and off a bridge two nights ago.,11
SCULLY,And?,1
DOGGETT,And somebody at the FBI thought it was important enough to stick his obituary right under our noses.,18
SCULLY,Who?,1
REYES,We don't know.,3
SCULLY,"Well, his blood alcohol level was up 0.15. He was drunk, he crashed and drowned.",15
DOGGETT,There's got to be something more.,6
DOGGETT,John Doggett.,2
SKINNER,What the hell are you doing?,6
DOGGETT,Excuse me?,2
SKINNER,Do you know how many people are just waiting to see you screw up. To see you make a mistake like this.,22
DOGGETT,I didn't know I made a mistake.,7
SKINNER,This EPA guy you checked out of the morgue in Maryland without any jurisdiction.,14
DOGGETT,"Oh, come on.",3
SKINNER,"All your friends, John. All your former buddies at the FBI.",11
DOGGETT,What are you talking about?,5
SKINNER,"They're not your pals any more. Not since this investigation here, since you launched an attack on one of your own. Just watch your back, John.",26
DOGGETT,"Definitive answer how this guy died, what'll that take?",9
SCULLY,Careful autopsy.,2
DOGGETT,How fast can you do it?,6
SCULLY,That's not what I'm saying.,5
DOGGETT,"I understand if you don't want to do this, Dana, but you're the only person we can trust.",18
FROHIKE,Collecting for the needy and unemployed. Open the door.,9
DOGGETT,"Thanks for doing this, guys.",5
BYERS,"Yeah, like we got anything better to be doing these days.",11
FROHIKE,"Just to let you know, we may need to get you up for some coin.",15
DOGGETT,"What happened to him, you guys?",6
LANGLY,Don't ask.,2
BYERS,We were able to hack into the Department of Interior's mainframe and get the EPA files you wanted. On this man Carl Wormus...,23
DOGGETT,And?,1
FROHIKE,"Hey, what are we mind readers? That's all that you asked us to do.",14
BYERS,"What exactly was it you are looking for, if we may ask?",12
DOGGETT,I don't know. I was hoping you'd find something.,9
LANGLY,"Well, if he had any secrets he took 'em to his grave. Nothing hinky in these files except for some rabid obsession with water.",24
DOGGETT,With water?,2
SCULLY,"Water. Asphyxiation produced by the inhalation of water>. There are contusions on the forehead and on the chest but that isn't in fact hat killed him. This man drowned. You're looking at me like you hope that there's something more, but there isn't.",43
REYES,"I'm sorry, that's not it. I'm just impressed that you can do this.",13
SCULLY,"This is what I do, Agent Reyes.",7
REYES,"But you're here doing it now. Something did happen, didn't it.",11
REYES,I know what you're afraid of. That there's something wrong with your baby.,13
SCULLY,"We can let our fears get the better of us. We can, uh, imagine things, make connections with things that aren't there. Like with this man.",26
REYES,"If you ever feel the need to talk to someone, Dana, I'm here. I'd never betray a confidence.",18
SCULLY,There is something.,3
REYES,What?,1
SCULLY,Right here on the ankle.,5
REYES,Are those... fingerprints?,3
SCULLY,"Yeah, that's what they look like.",6
REYES,Was someone holding him down?,5
SCULLY,"I don't know how, or who.",6
FOLLMER,I don't know if you're aware where Agent Scully is. She's at Quantico. Called in by John Doggett to autopsy a body he's got not authority to touch.,28
FOLLMER,"If I may be blunt, Sir, Doggett's put his tit in the wringer.",13
KERSH,Maybe. So what?,3
FOLLMER,All of think he's lost all judgment. That not one man's actions should affect the entire FBI. We're feeling he should be called out for this.,26
KERSH,Punished?,1
FOLLMER,"Yes, Sir.",2
KERSH,"Thank you, Assistant Director. It's a difficult situation to be in, I appreciate you doing this.",16
FOLLMER,It was a right thing to do.,7
KERSH,Let me know how it goes.,6
FOLLMER,"Me? No, no, I can't, Sir. There... there is a conflict. I, I can't do this myself.",17
KERSH,I can't very well do it. How would it look? I'm under investigation by Agent Doggett. You have no personal axe to grind.,23
MARGARET,Hello? Can I help you?,5
SHANNON MCMAHON,"Hi, I'm looking for Dana Scully.",6
MARGARET,"Uh, I'm sorry, she's not here right now. Can I tell her who's calling?",14
SHANNON MCMAHON,We work together. Do you know where I can find her?,11
MARGARET,"No, um, would you like to leave a message?",9
SHANNON MCMAHON,I'll leave a note if you wouldn't mind opening the door.,11
MARGARET,Why don't you just leave your name and I'll have Dana call you.,13
SCULLY,I need to get this body into refrigeration if you want to preserve it as evidence. Whatever he's evidence of...,20
REYES,Whatever it is I can't reach John to even tell him about it.,13
SCULLY,"Monica, I don't know what to say, but good luck. I gotta go. I gotta get home.",17
SCULLY,Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers. We could temporarily put him up there.,17
REYES,Behind us. Just keep walking.,5
SCULLY,Who is she?,3
REYES,I've never seen her before this morning. Now I've seen her twice.,12
FOLLMER,Where's Agent Doggett?,3
REYES,"What are you doing, Brad?",5
FOLLMER,What am I doing? I'm doing my best to cover your ass.,12
REYES,What are you talking about?,5
FOLLMER,This... and this... I'm talking about these.,7
REYES,Let go of me.,4
SCULLY,What's going on here?,4
FOLLMER,"Okay, where'd he go?",4
REYES,Who? Where'd who go?,4
FOLLMER,Where did Doggett take the body?,6
REYES,"You're not making any sense, Brad. Agent Doggett didn't take any body anywhere.",13
REYES,What? You're looking at me like you don't believe me. Ask Agent Scully.,13
SCULLY,I'm gonna go now. I've got a child at home.,10
FOLLMER,"Body or no body, you were here, doing an autopsy. Doggett was here, without authorization.",15
REYES,Without authorization?,2
FOLLMER,"He's out of control you know, Monica. Forget the X-Files, he'll take you down with him.",16
REYES,"This was you, wasn't it? You floated that obituary to me... to set Agent Doggett up, using me.",18
FOLLMER,"What obituary? I don't know what you are talking about. You came to me for help, remember? I'm only trying to help you help yourself.",25
REYES,"I know exactly what you're doing, Brad. Don't forget to piss on all the corners before you leave.",18
FOLLMER,I didn't float any obituary!,5
FOLLMER,What is she talking about?,5
FROHIKE,Son of a...,3
FROHIKE,Yeah?,1
FROHIKE,"Oh, hello.",2
REYES,"Considering the recent violence against Agent Doggett, you might want to want to know who's at the door before you actually open it.",23
FROHIKE,Next time I'll get a chair.,6
BYERS,Agent Doggett's gone.,3
REYES,What do you mean gone?,5
LANGLY,He and Assistant Director Skinner split for Maryland together.,9
FROHIKE,Show her what we found. Before she makes any nasty remarks.,11
BYERS,"It took some real hacking but uh, Carl Wormus, the man from Environmental Protection Agency who drowned in his car, he'd been receiving encrypted email data from a water reclamation plant in Maryland. From a worker there named Roland McFarland.",40
REYES,Encrypted data on what?,4
LANGLY,Don't know. Whatever it is may have gotten both these men killed.,12
SKINNER,There's no nameplates.,3
DOGGETT,"Yeah, I see that.",4
SKINNER,This is madness. Even if you're right and this guy can actually help your investigation we don't know if we're in the right area.,24
DOGGETT,This has got to be McFarland's area.,7
SKINNER,This might be his desk.,5
SKINNER,Let's just grab the computer hard drive and get out of here.,12
DOGGETT,We're not sure if it's his.,6
SKINNER,Someone could walk in one of these doors any minute and it's not gonna matter.,15
DOGGETT,Just keep an eye out.,5
DOGGETT,What's chloramine?,2
SKINNER,What? Why are you asking me about chloramine?,8
DOGGETT,If this is McFarland's desk he's got tons of files on chloramine in it.,14
SKINNER,Agent Doggett - grab the files and go.,7
SKINNER,Arghhh!,1
DOGGETT,Assistant Director?,2
FOLLMER,Looks like you and I are chasing the same man.,10
FOLLMER,Agent Doggett?!,2
