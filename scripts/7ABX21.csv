JAY GILMORE,"Anson? Anson, where are you, Anson? Anson, come back, Anson. Anson. Calling Anson. Where are you, Anson? Anson! Anson, calling Anson. Where are you, Anson? Anson! Where are you, Anson?",30
JAY GILMORE,Anson! Get out here.,4
JAY GILMORE,"I warned you about your attitude. Did you clean out 407? No... of course you haven't cleaned out 407. You've only had all damn morning. You think you're ever going to own any of those boats in that magazine the way you're going, huh? Do you think you're ever going to amount to anything? You can't even finish a simple job.",61
ANSON STOKES,"A monkey could do this job, right, Jay?",8
JAY GILMORE,"Well, you can't, so what's that say about you?",9
ANSON STOKES,"Oh, shut up.",3
JAY GILMORE,"Excuse me? I didn't catch that. You clean out 407. You move out that deadbeat's stuff, and you do it now. And when I come back in an hour, it better be done.",33
JAY GILMORE,Anson... Anson? Son of a... Anson. Anson!,7
JAY GILMORE,"Aw, that's it, Anson. Do you hear me, Anson?",9
MULDER,Can I get you some coffee? Water? Anything?,8
SCULLY,Morning.,1
MULDER,Morning.,1
MULDER,"Special Agent Dana Scully, this is, uh, this is Jay Gilmore.",11
SCULLY,Nice to meet you.,4
JAY GILMORE,Nice to meet...,3
JAY GILMORE,Likewise.,1
MULDER,"Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri, the ""Show Me"" state.",15
JAY GILMORE,They told me you were the people to best understand my situ... My sit...,14
MULDER,"It's okay. Uh, this is Mr. Gilmore's... situation. This condition came on very suddenly about a month ago.",18
JAY GILMORE,"Anson Stokes-- he did this to me. I don't know how, I just... I know it was him.",18
MULDER,"Anson Stokes is a former employee at the, uh, self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns. Uh, apparently, there was some bad blood between you two.",25
JAY GILMORE,He told me to shut up! Huh?!,7
MULDER,"Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore was, uh... stricken...",8
MULDER,"Stricken... stricken, and Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found. He resurfaced several days later and the police wanted to question him. But he refused.",25
JAY GILMORE,Do you know what he said? He said they had nothing on him.,13
MULDER,"Well, and to be fair, sir, they didn't-- they don't.",10
JAY GILMORE,They had to make me a whole new mouth. Do you think Blue Cross is going to pay for this? Uh-uh.,21
JAY GILMORE,I demand justice!,3
SCULLY,"Look, Mulder, all I'm saying is...",6
MULDER,I know-- this may not be a crime and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it.,18
SCULLY,"But there is a condition called microstomia-- ""small mouth""-- which is, uh, it's brought on by the disease scleroderma and it's the overproduction of collagen and it can actually reduce a person's mouth to a tiny little opening.",38
MULDER,"Yeah, but that takes months to develop, right? It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye. Gilmore's surgeons are stumped. They're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine.",33
SCULLY,"Well, there's always nasal aplasia-- the complete absence of a nose.",11
MULDER,"That's a nose, Scully; we're talking mouth here.",8
SCULLY,"Yeah, but what we're talking, Mulder, is medical-- physiological-- not criminal. Not as far as I can see.",18
MULDER,"Well, maybe, but I still want to know why Anson Stokes doesn't want to talk to the police.",18
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,"That's a little... out of place, wouldn't you say?",9
MULDER,A little bit.,3
ANSON STOKES,"Aw, damn it. Leslie!",4
LESLIE STOKES,What? What is it?,4
ANSON STOKES,"They're I.R.S. agents. They got to be. Listen, get rid of them, all right?",14
SCULLY,Hi. We're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes.,8
LESLIE STOKES,He's not here.,3
SCULLY,"Well, do you happen to know when he's coming back?",10
SCULLY,"Well, we are, uh, Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.",11
LESLIE STOKES,"Oh, the boat's... the boat's not ours. The boat … I'm... we're just holding it for someone, and, you know-- they pay the taxes on it.",26
SCULLY,Okay...,1
LESLIE STOKES,Anson's not here.,3
MULDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your name?",7
LESLIE STOKES,Leslie Stokes.,2
MULDER,"Oh, you're Anson's brother?",4
MULDER,"Hi, there.",2
MULDER,"We're not here to talk about the boat, Leslie. We want to talk to your brother about his former employer. Mr. Gilmore?",22
SCULLY,"And the, uh... unfortunate condition that he's found himself in. Would you happen to know anything about that?",18
LESLIE STOKES,"What, the mouth thing? Yeah, well, that-- you know, that's-that's just, uh, that's, like... chemicals.",15
SCULLY,Chemicals?,1
LESLIE STOKES,"Yeah, you know, like, people store weird chemicals, well like... my brother one time, he smelled this weird smell? You know, he's just a guy with a meth lab, like in one of the storage units, so you know, that's actually probably something you guys should look into-- take a look into that... you know, I'm going to get going, so I'm going to go, okay?",66
SCULLY,Okay.,1
MULDER,Now I see what's going on here.,7
SCULLY,"Well, according to Gilmore he was standing right where I am when it happened.",14
MULDER,"Well, I don't smell any weird chemical smells. You still have both your lips.",14
SCULLY,"Apparently, everything is left as it was.",7
MULDER,Hey... 1978. It's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day.,18
SCULLY,"Well, it's too bad, Mulder. Underneath all this dust, this furniture is really wonderful.",14
MULDER,"Oh, well, you want to hit some yard sales while we're out here?",13
SCULLY,"Mulder, this furniture is expensive, very expensive.",7
MULDER,What's your point?,3
SCULLY,"My point is that, uh... there's a lot of money sitting around here and maybe something's missing.",17
MULDER,Like what?,2
SCULLY,"I don't know-- jewelry. I mean, Anson Stokes opened up this storage unit and then he just disappeared.",18
MULDER,And winds up with the Titanic in his driveway?,9
SCULLY,Mm-hmm. There's your crime: Theft.,5
MULDER,That still doesn't explain what happened to Gilmore.,8
SCULLY,Well...,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully, check this out.",5
SCULLY,Ouch.,1
MULDER,This woman look familiar to you?,6
SCULLY,That's the woman from the trailer.,6
MULDER,That's the –young- woman from the trailer. How many centuries now has disco been dead?,15
ANSON STOKES,"Two down. Two down, I got nothing to show for it.",11
LESLIE STOKES,You got the boat.,4
ANSON STOKES,"And what the hell good is that? Huh? That thing is like a big... you know, big...",17
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,White elephant?,2
ANSON STOKES,What? I'm sorry. What does that mean?,7
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,It's a big expensive item that serves no purpose and is ultimately more trouble than it's worth.,17
ANSON STOKES,So what the hell did you give it to me for?,11
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Because you asked for it.,5
ANSON STOKES,Fine. You know what? I can appreciate that. That's... but don't you think maybe you could've found some frickin' water to put it in?,24
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,You didn't specify water.,4
ANSON STOKES,I got to specify that you put a boat in the frickin' water? That is a given. Frickin' white elephant. I can't even pay the taxes on it.,28
LESLIE STOKES,"Why don't you just, uh, use your last wish to get rid of it?",14
ANSON STOKES,"You want me to put you in a home or something, maybe, right now? Because I just told you, Leslie, that I wasted two wishes, okay? And I am not... are you listening? I am not going to waste the third. All right? Come on. Come on. We got to concentrate here. Now, let me figure this out. Let me figure this out. Third wish, third wish, third wish, final wish. Hey, I'm just spit-balling here, all right? If I happen to say, ""I wish,"" by accident, that does not count, not until I am absolutely ready, okay?",98
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,You could always give that guy his mouth back.,9
ANSON STOKES,"Hey, all I said was that I wish Jay would shut the hell up. If you feel bad about what you did to him fix it on your own dime, okay?",31
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,It doesn't work like that.,5
ANSON STOKES,"Whatever. Leslie, would you help me out here?",8
LESLIE STOKES,Uh... Money. Wish for money.,5
ANSON STOKES,"Yeah, okay, that's not bad. That's not bad, that's not bad, but don't you think maybe we should think of something that would, generate money instead of the, actually the money itself?",32
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Brains? Talent? Hard work?,4
LESLIE STOKES,Uh... A money machine. Huh?,5
ANSON STOKES,"That's not... but something better. Something better. Okay, but...",9
LESLIE STOKES,An infinite number of wishes?,5
ANSON STOKES,Okay.,1
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Just three boys. Settle down.,5
ANSON STOKES,"Damn it, this is hard.",5
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"You know, I have a thought. Granted, it's pretty obvious.",10
ANSON STOKES,"What? What, what, what?",4
ANSON STOKES,What?,1
LESLIE STOKES,What?,1
ANSON STOKES,"Seriously, what?",2
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"Oh, forget it.",3
ANSON STOKES,I got it.,3
LESLIE STOKES,Yeah?,1
ANSON STOKES,"I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay. Okay. Are you ready? Because I am ready. I am absolutely ready. Okay, here goes. I wish that I could turn invisible … at will.",38
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,You're kidding.,2
ANSON STOKES,"No, no. This is perfect. Yeah, I could have an advantage that nobody else on earth can have. I can, um, you know, spy and learn secret information, pick up stock tips.",32
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Sneak into a women's locker room.,6
ANSON STOKES,"Not just that, okay? I'm talking about James Bond type stuff. You know?",13
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Your wish is breathtaking in its un-originality.,7
ANSON STOKES,"You don't have to like it, all right? You just have to do it. Right?",15
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Done.,1
ANSON STOKES,"My clothes are going to turn invisible, too, right?",9
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,You didn't specify clothes.,4
ANSON STOKES,"I know, but... screw it.",5
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"Oh, God. Turn invisible please.",5
ANSON STOKES,"Yes! Oh, man, this is awesome! Hey. Hey, brother. Hey, Leslie? I'm over here. Oop, I'm over here. Can you see me?",22
ANSON STOKES,Oof. Ow! Damn it.,4
LESLIE STOKES,"Anson, you all right?",4
ANSON STOKES,"Yeah, I am. I can't see my damn feet. Look out, world! Here I come! Whoo-hoo!",16
ANSON STOKES,"I'm invisible! Invisible, baby! Whoo!",5
LESLIE STOKES,Whoo-oo!,1
ANSON STOKES,"Yes! You can't see me, can you!",7
LESLIE STOKES,I...,1
LESLIE STOKES,"Hey, uh...?",2
ANSON STOKES,"Hey, out of my way, birds.",6
ANSON STOKES,"Hello, ladies.",2
ANSON STOKES,"Yeah, here comes Anson. That's right. Come on, come on, come on. Change, change.",14
ANSON STOKES,"All right, here we go. Need a little roadside assistance, do ya? Well, not to worry. Here comes Anson.",19
KID,Whooooaaa!!!,1
MORGUE ATTENDANT,Can we go now?,4
SCULLY,Mm-hmm.,1
MULDER,I think you missed a spot here. I can see straight through to his ass.,15
MULDER,"This is Anson Stokes, huh?",5
SCULLY,It is. His dental records are a match. He was found about half a mile from his house. He was probably hit by a car or a truck or... something.,30
MULDER,And he's invisible.,3
SCULLY,"Yes, he is.",3
SCULLY,"You know, Mulder, in the seven years that we've been working together I have seen some amazing things, but this? This takes the cake. It's... it's going to change the boundaries of science.",33
MULDER,"It is amazing, but I don't think it has anything to do with science. Remember Mr. Saturday Night Fever?",19
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,"I did a little background checking. His real name is Henry Flanken. He redefined the term ""overnight success."" In 1977, his net worth was $36,000, and in 1978 it was $30 million. Then there is the interesting way in which Mr. Flanken died.",43
SCULLY,How's that?,2
MULDER,Chronic morbid tumescence.,3
SCULLY,You don't mean what I think you mean?,8
MULDER,"Sch-wing. On April 4, 1978, he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital with an extreme priapic condition. Apparently, he was quite the specimen. They had to raise the doorframe in order to wheel him into his hospital room.",38
SCULLY,"Well, what does any of that have to do with this?",11
MULDER,"Well, I think our mystery woman is the link. About whom I can find no information whatsoever. I think she's responsible for all of this.",25
SCULLY,But how?,2
MULDER,I... I don't know. But... we need to talk to her.,11
SCULLY,"Uh, I think that I should stay here with the body. I mean, I... you know, I don't think it's a good idea to leave him unguarded. You know, this is truly amazing.",33
MULDER,Okay.,1
MULDER,I'm very sorry for your loss.,6
LESLIE STOKES,"Anson didn't suffer, did he?",5
MULDER,"No, I don't think he suffered. The part about him being invisible-- that doesn't, uh, catch you off guard just a little bit?",23
LESLIE STOKES,Uh...,1
MULDER,"Leslie, there was a woman here earlier. Where is she now?",11
LESLIE STOKES,"She's, uh... she's gone.",4
MULDER,"Uh, let me tell you where I'm going with this. I think that woman is a jinniyah. Are you familiar with that term?",23
LESLIE STOKES,No.,1
MULDER,It's the feminine for jinni-- as in a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore.,15
MULDER,"Yeah, except Barbara Eden never killed anybody. All right, now in Arabic mythology they speak of these beings that are composed of flame or air but take human form. They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes. They live in inanimate objects like a lamp or a ring. Is this beginning to sound familiar?",55
MULDER,"Leslie, I believe your brother found just such an object in the storage facility, didn't he? He took possession of the jinniyah and he made some pretty outrageous requests, like Jay Gilmore's mouth and the yacht in the driveway.",39
LESLIE STOKES,"Oh, wait, wait. You believe all that?",7
MULDER,"I do. And, Leslie, for your own safety-- so that what happened to your brother doesn't happen to you-- I think you should hand over that object to me right now.",31
MULDER,You're doing the right thing.,5
MULDER,"Hey, Scully, come check this out.",6
MULDER,"Come on, he's not going anywhere. Come on.",8
SCULLY,Bye.,1
SCULLY,I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical. Can't wait to see their faces.,17
SCULLY,What's this?,2
MULDER,"It's not what I hoped it would be. Judging from the odor coming inside, I think it's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed.",24
MULDER,But that's not what I wanted to show you. Recognize him?,11
SCULLY,Benito Mussolini.,2
MULDER,How about her?,3
SCULLY,Your mystery woman. Or someone who looks a lot like her.,11
MULDER,"Well, the computer says it is her. I ran her through Quantico's facial recognition software and couldn't come up with a match in the known felon database. Then I took a flier and checked with the image bank at the national archives. Voila.",43
SCULLY,"Well, even if it is her, Mulder, what would she be doing with Mussolini?",14
MULDER,"Or Richard Nixon, for that matter.",6
MULDER,I don't know. Except that they're both men who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it.,21
LESLIE STOKES,"See? I told you it'd look good in here. Nice rug. How do you breathe in that thing, huh?",19
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"Can we just get this over with, please? Three wishes. Go.",11
LESLIE STOKES,"Okay. Don't rush me, all right? I want to do this right. Got to be smarter than Anson was.",19
LESLIE STOKES,"Damn it, Anson.",3
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"Then, can I once again offer you a suggestion?",9
LESLIE STOKES,Hmm?,1
LESLIE STOKES,What?,1
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"This. Your disability? There was some tragedy involved here, I assume.",11
LESLIE STOKES,"Yeah, well, yeah, it was pretty tragic, I guess. Me and Anson were playing mailbox baseball. God, I miss that. And Anson's driving. I was leaning pretty far out the window there. Oh. You mean this?",36
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Mm-hmm.,1
LESLIE STOKES,"Yeah, you're right. I could wish for a solid gold wheelchair. Man, that'd be sweet.",15
LESLIE STOKES,I see what you're saying but you know what? There's something I want more than that.,16
SCULLY,You're not going to believe your eyes. I certainly didn't. You ready?,12
SCULLY,"Uh, he's, uh... he's invisible... after all... Um...",8
SCULLY,He's in there.,3
LESLIE STOKES,Okay. You know what? He's creeping me out. This isn't what I asked for. He's all weird and messed up.,20
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,He's been hit by a truck. What did you expect?,10
LESLIE STOKES,I asked you to bring him back to normal.,9
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,You asked me to bring him back.,7
LESLIE STOKES,"Okay, you know, the...",4
LESLIE STOKES,"Now, he's starting to smell bad! Come on-- this isn't what I wanted! Look, he's got to at least be able to talk. Okay... You know what? That's my next wish.",31
WISH NUMBER TWO,I wish Anson could talk.,5
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"No, you don't.",3
LESLIE STOKES,"Yes, I do and that's final. I wish Anson could talk.",11
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Done.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, I should just shoot myself. Oh... I was so happy. I was so excited. What was I thinking? An invisible man?",22
MULDER,You saw it. It was real.,6
SCULLY,"I don't know what I saw, Mulder. I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands it was just too good to be true.",27
MULDER,I don't think that's why the body disappeared.,8
SCULLY,Why did the body disappear?,5
MULDER,I think it was the result of a wish being granted.,11
SCULLY,A wish? Whose wish?,4
MULDER,"Well, who would want Anson Stokes back? I mean, really, really back.",12
SCULLY,"His brother, Leslie.",3
LESLIE STOKES,"Well, this is no good.",5
ANSON STOKES,What did you do to me?,6
LESLIE STOKES,"What? You're back from the dead, man. What kind of gratitude is that?",13
ANSON STOKES,What did you do to me?,6
LESLIE STOKES,I wasted two wishes on you. That's what I did.,10
ANSON STOKES,I can't feel my heart.,5
ANSON STOKES,I-I can't feel my blood. I am yellow! I'm cold.,10
LESLIE STOKES,Screw this!,2
ANSON STOKES,I'm cold. I'm cold.,4
LESLIE STOKES,I wasted two wishes on you. And a perfectly good bowl of corn flakes.,14
LESLIE STOKES,"There, I turned the heat up. Are you happy now? Huh? Are you happy? Is there anything else I can do for you there, buddy?",25
LESLIE STOKES,What do you say? Maybe wipe your little yellow butt? Thanks for nothing.,13
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,"You want to make your third wish, champ? I'd like to get out of here before the blowflies hatch.",19
LESLIE STOKES,"Yeah, I tell you what-- my last wish is going to be for me, okay? It's going to be for me, you hear that, Anson? I wasted two wishes on you and you don't even give a damn about that! All right... third wish. Uh... let's see, I could wish for, uh... I could wish for money. Not everybody wishes for money.",62
ANSON STOKES,It's so cold.,3
LESLIE STOKES,"No, um... or there's the invisibility thing. I guess that turned out pretty stupid huh? Anson? To be invisible! That was real smart, huh?",24
LESLIE STOKES,"Uh... X-ray eyes, maybe? No, that would be... hmm, like you said, solid gold wheelchair.",15
LESLIE STOKES,"Uh... wait, I got it-- legs!",6
MULDER,"Would you mind removing your eyewear, ma'am?",7
MULDER,Ah. Do you have a name?,6
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,Not for a long time now.,6
MULDER,"How about if I call you Jenn? That's short for ""jinniyah.""",11
SCULLY,"The, uh... the fire department just recovered two bodies.",9
MULDER,"Leslie Stokes and his brother, Anson.",6
SCULLY,"Looks like it. And, uh, Anson Stokes is visible now. Of course.",12
SCULLY,But what I'd really love an explanation for is how his corpse got from my locked morgue all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.,28
JENN,Ask him. He's got it all figured out.,8
SCULLY,"I know what he'd say. He'd say that you're some kind of a jinni from 1,001 Nights or something like that and that you grant people wishes.",27
JENN,"Well, there you have it.",5
MULDER,"Well, one thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether you're a good jinni or an evil one. Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end.",32
JENN,That's the conclusion you've drawn? That I'm evil?,8
MULDER,"Well, possibly evil. Possibly cursed. A curse to others.",9
JENN,The only thing you people are cursed with is stupidity. All of you. Everybody. Mankind. Everyone I have ever come into contact with without fail. Always asking for the wrong thing.,31
MULDER,You mean making the wrong wishes.,6
JENN,"Yeah, it's always: ""Give me money. Give me big boobs. "" ""Give me a big hoo-hoo. Make me cool like the Fonz."" Or whoever's the big name now.",27
MULDER,You been out of circulation a long time.,8
JENN,"So what? In 500 years, people have not changed a bit.",11
SCULLY,500 years.,2
JENN,"Granted, they smell better now generally speaking but human greed still reigns... shallowness... a propensity for self-destruction.",17
SCULLY,You're saying that you have been a firsthand witness to 500 years of human history.,15
JENN,"I used to be human. I was born in 15th century France and then, one day, an old Moor came to my village peddling rugs and I unrolled one that an Ifrit had taken residence in.",36
SCULLY,"""An Ifrit.""",2
JENN,"A very... powerful class of jinni. He offered me three wishes. For the first I asked for a stouthearted mule. For the second, a magic sack that was always full of turnips...",32
JENN,Did I mention this was 15th century France?,8
MULDER,What was your third wish?,5
JENN,"My third... I pondered for a great while. I didn't want to waste it. So, finally, feeling very intelligent I spoke up and I said ""Je souhaite un grand pouvoir et une longue vie."" ""I wish for great power and long life.""",42
MULDER,And thus became a jinni yourself.,6
JENN,Gave me the mark of the jinn... … right there. It's forever. Sort of like a prison tattoo.,18
JENN,"I should've been more specific. So, am I under arrest?",10
SCULLY,"I can't think of anything we have to hold you on. And, not surprisingly we don't have any evidence of any of this, so, uh... I think she's free to go.",31
JENN,"No, I'm not. He unrolled me.",6
MULDER,I get three wishes.,4
JENN,So your partner left the airport rather quickly. And I don't think she likes me very much.,17
MULDER,"I don't think she knows what to make of you. I don't think I do either, really.",17
JENN,"Well, you could always give up your three wishes. I'll disappear-- no hard feelings.",14
MULDER,Mmmm.,1
JENN,"I didn't think so. So, what's your first wish?",9
MULDER,Well...,1
MULDER,What would your wish be if you were in my place?,11
JENN,I'm not you. It doesn't matter.,6
MULDER,"But, I just... you know, I'd like to know.",9
JENN,"I'd... wish that I'd never heard the word ""wish"" before. I'd wish that I could live my life moment by moment... enjoying it for what it is instead of... instead of worrying about what it isn't.",36
JENN,"I'd... sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee and I'd watch the world go by. But then again, I'm not you. So I doubt that's your wish.",29
MULDER,"You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here. You say that most people make the wrong wishes, right?",21
JENN,Without fail. It's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver.,9
MULDER,This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain.,11
JENN,Could be.,2
MULDER,"So the trick would be to make a wish that's totally altruistic. That's for everyone. So, um... I wish for peace on earth.",23
JENN,Peace on earth. That's it?,5
MULDER,What the hell's wrong with that? You can't do it?,10
JENN,No. I can.,3
JENN,It's done.,2
MULDER,"Oh, crap.",2
MULDER,I guess I should have seen this coming! Scully.,9
MULDER,Scully?,1
MULDER,Hello? Hello?,2
MULDER,"Very good. Jinni? Jinni, whatever the hell your name is...",10
JENN,Yes?,1
MULDER,What the hell is this?,5
JENN,It's what you asked for. Peace on earth. Listen.,9
MULDER,You know damn well that's not what I meant.,9
JENN,You didn't specify.,3
MULDER,This has nothing to do with specificity. You don't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet just to effect a little peace on earth and goodwill towards men.,32
JENN,You didn't say goodwill towards men. So you expect me to change the hearts of six billion people? No religion in history has been able to pull that off. Not Allah or Buddha or Christ. But you'd like me to do that in your name? So... what? You can feel real good about yourself?,54
MULDER,Did I say that? I didn't say that.,8
JENN,"Mm, how grotesquely egotistical of you. I bet you wish you hadn't made your first wish.",16
MULDER,"Yes, I do, since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely. And another thing-- I think you've got a really horrible attitude. I guess that comes from being rolled up in a rug for the last 500 years.",40
MULDER,But we're not all that stupid. We're not all chimpanzees with revolvers. I think there's another possibility here and that's just that you're a bitch.,25
SKINNER,Agent Mulder?,2
MULDER,Sir.,1
SKINNER,How did you get in here?,6
MULDER,Uh...,1
(THE WISH,"""Whereas, I have one wish left and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind, and whereas this wish contains great potential for the betterment of life as we know it, and that equal potential for grave danger, chaos, and mayhem, let effect, a world run amok, and whereas, I must cover all bases…""",58
JENN,"""Whereas, I have one wish left and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind"" yadda, yadda, yadda... ""Here on this plane of existence..."" Hmm... Hmm-hmm. What, are you a lawyer?",35
MULDER,"Well, I have to be with you. I'm going to get this last wish perfect. I'm not going to leave you any loopholes. I'm not going to let you interpret this as an edict to bring back the Third Reich or to make everyone's eyes grow on stalks.",48
JENN,"Oh, geez. And I was so looking forward to that.",10
SCULLY,"Skinner called me, Mulder. Is everything all right?",8
MULDER,You don't remember disappearing off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning?,16
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,"Well, I guess everything's okay.",5
SCULLY,Mul...,1
SCULLY,"Could you give us a minute, please?",7
JENN,Sure.,1
SCULLY,Like today?,2
SCULLY,Wh … Where the hell did she go?,8
MULDER,Boink!,1
SCULLY,No... It's got to be hypnotism or mesmerism or … something.,11
MULDER,"Scully, it is what it is. You examined an invisible body, remember?",12
