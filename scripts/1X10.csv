WOMAN,What's she doing there by herself?,6
MAN,Teena?,1
WOMAN,Honey?,1
WOMAN,You're freezing. Where's your jacket?,5
MAN,Where's your Daddy?,3
TEENA,In the yard. He told me he needed some time to himself.,12
MAN,I'd say his time's up.,5
WOMAN,"Come on, Honey. I'm sure he wouldn't want you to catch cold.",12
MAN,"Joel? Hey, Joel... The swing set's supposed to be for your daughter, not for you.",15
MAN,I'll call 911.,3
TEENA,Daddy?,1
SCULLY,Death by hypovolaemia. 95% blood loss. That's over 4 liters of blood.,12
MULDER,I'd say the man was running on empty.,8
SCULLY,"The man's daughter, 8 years old... was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes. She doesn't remember anything, there was no trace evidence found at the crime scene.",31
MULDER,Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday's rain.,10
SCULLY,"Oh, there were two small puncture wounds.",7
MULDER,Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations?,11
MULDER,"Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilations. Trace evidence is remarkably similar. Incision marks of surgical precision. The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs have been removed. There's a substantial degree of blood loss but not a trace of blood at the scene.",51
SCULLY,How could that be?,4
MULDER,"Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular of any living creature, the heart itself would act as a pump. These animals have had their jugulars punctured the same as the man in Greenwich, CT. Although this is the first time I've ever seen it on a human being.",52
SCULLY,But there was no sign of a struggle. How could a man just sit through a blood letting?,18
MULDER,"The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.",18
SCULLY,"Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Often there are related sightings in the sky near the incidences, along with surface burns...",24
MULDER,Witnesses often relate time loss. We've seen this in abduction cases. That might explain why the girl can't remember anything.,20
SCULLY,"Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space in order to play doctor on cattle?",17
MULDER,"For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.",19
SOCIAL WORKER,Her mother passed away from ovarian cancer two years ago. There's no other family. We'll keep Teena here until we can place her with a foster family.,27
MULDER,Has she spoken about it?,5
SOCIAL WORKER,No. Not a word.,4
MULDER,Any nightmares?,2
SOCIAL WORKER,"No. At least, not that I know of.",8
SCULLY,Can we talk to her now?,6
SOCIAL WORKER,Teena? These are the people we talked about. This is Miss Scully and Mr. Mulder. Do you think you could talk to them?,23
SCULLY,Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. But we want to find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy. Okay?,31
SCULLY,Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?,12
SCULLY,Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?,15
TEENA,No.,1
SCULLY,Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy?,12
TEENA,No.,1
MULDER,"Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? About what happened in the back yard?",18
MULDER,Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?,13
TEENA,There was Red Lightening.,4
MULDER,Can you tell me more about the Red Lightening?,9
TEENA,I can't remember... it all went dark.,7
MULDER,Had you ever seen anything like that before?,8
MULDER,Yeah? When?,2
TEENA,"The men from the clouds, they were after my dad.",10
SCULLY,Scully... Where?,2
MULDER,Why were these men after your Dad?,7
TEENA,They wanted to exsanguinate him.,5
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,There's been another one.,4
MULDER,It's like looking at a mirror image.,7
SCULLY,"The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause of death, hypovilemia. Mulder, this is crazy. They also found traces of the poison digitalis.",25
MULDER,Puncture wounds?,2
SCULLY,"Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2:30 p.m. Same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.",23
MULDER,That's Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment.,11
SCULLY,It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.,10
MULDER,"No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they kill together not separately.",16
SCULLY,"Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.",14
MULDER,Is Reardon's daughter nearby when he was murdered?,8
SCULLY,Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Ah... she's with her mother and family in Sacramento.,18
MULDER,When will they be back?,5
SCULLY,Tomorrow.,1
MULDER,Even money... she'll remember Red Lightening.,6
FAIRFIELD COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES HOSTEL 12,35 AM E.S.T. It is night. There is a storm outside. Lightening and thunder. Teena is in bed. She is holding her stuffed bunny. She lifts her head off the pillow. She looks at the window and gets out of bed. She checks through the window in the door if someone is in the hall. She pushes a chair in front of it. Someone on the other side of the door is trying to break in. Teena hides under the bed. Someone enters the room. Teena tries to make a break for it. A figure grabs her arm.,98
SOCIAL WORKER,Teena? Teena? Teena! All that remains is Teena's stuffed bunny by the open window. Rain beating down on it.,19
SCULLY,She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. last night. Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.,23
MULDER,"Someone or something, Scully.",4
SCULLY,Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an hour. Nothing.,13
MULDER,Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction.,8
SCULLY,I told them to contact us if they happen to find her.,12
SCULLY,Teena?,1
CINDY,No.,1
SCULLY,What's your name?,3
CINDY,Cindy Reardon.,2
MULDER,"You live here, Cindy?",4
CINDY,"Ever since I was born, 8 years ago.",8
MULDER,"Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon.",9
MRS REARDON,Doug and I wanted to spoil her. We wanted to protect her from everything horrible in the world. She was daddy's little girl.,23
MULDER,Is she an only child?,5
SCULLY,May I ask... Was Cindy adopted?,6
MRS REARDON,No. I gave birth to her at San Rafael General.,10
SCULLY,"So, I assume you have all the proper documentation. Birth certificate...",11
MRS REARDON,Of course I do.,4
MULDER,Was she the only child delivered at that birth?,9
MRS REARDON,"What the hell kind of question is that? Look, I have told the police everything I know.",17
MULDER,"Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?",9
MRS REARDON,This... is this your suspect?,5
MULDER,No.,1
MRS REARDON,Did he do something to Cindy?,6
MULDER,No... he... he did... he didn't...,6
SCULLY,"No. Mrs. Reardon. This is not your daughter. That girl's name is Teena Simmons. She lives 3,000 miles away in Connecticut. That man, her father, was killed in the same manner as your husband.",34
MRS REARDON,Cindy is my daughter. I can show you videos of her birth. We tried for six years to become pregnant.,20
MULDER,In vitro fertilization?,3
MULDER,At which clinic?,3
MRS REARDON,Luther Stapes Center. Down in San Francisco.,7
MULDER,Thanks.,1
SCULLY,Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn't see Red Lightening.,14
MULDER,I don't know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn't seem to be their appearance.,16
SCULLY,"Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people can have an unrelated likeness.",16
MULDER,Who both just happened to see their father's exsanguinated. I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas.,19
SCULLY,The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.,11
MULDER,One girl was just abducted.,5
SCULLY,Kidnaped.,1
MULDER,"Potato, potahto.",2
SCULLY,Where are you going?,4
MULDER,The murders were committed by the same person or persons. Part of the pattern involves kidnaping the daughter.,18
SCULLY,And you expect the pattern to continue.,7
MULDER,I'm going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. See if the Simmons were enrolled in the same fertility program.,25
SCULLY,Okay. I'll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.,13
MULDER,Okay.,1
DOCTOR,In vitro fertilization is a procedure in which we can implement fertilization. An implantation of the embryo to the uterus.,20
SCULLY,Could a patient have believed she was receiving her own eggs but actually receive another without her knowledge?,18
DOCTOR,Not here. We have very strict controls.,7
SCULLY,Are you ever aware of having patients by the name of Claudia and Joel Simmons?,15
DOCTOR,Any information about patients is confidential. That's our policy.,9
SCULLY,Both the Simmons are dead. And their daughter has been kidnaped. I think any information that you have that could help overrides your policy.,24
SCULLY,"You have copies of their records sent to Greenwich, CT, in 1991... They came here 9 years ago under the supervision of a Dr. Sally Kendrick?",26
SCULLY,There a problem?,3
DOCTOR,Dr. Kendrick was nothing but a problem.,7
SALLY KENDRICK ON TAPE,"Hello. And welcome to the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine. I'm Dr. Sally Kendrick, a specialist in the exciting field of in vitro fertilization.",25
DOCTOR,"She was a resident here in 1985. Brilliant. First in her class at Yale med where she got her MD. After completing her doctorate in Bio Genetics, we were thrilled to get her.",33
SCULLY,And now you don't sound too thrilled.,7
DOCTOR,We have reason to believe that Dr. Kendrick was tampering with genetic material that was fertilized in the lab prior to implant. Experimenting with Eugenics.,25
SCULLY,Did you report this to the AMA?,7
DOCTOR,Of course. And I fired her. And also requested an investigation with the Health Department.,15
SCULLY,And what happened?,3
DOCTOR,The AMA censured her. My request for an investigation was denied. Dr. Kendrick disappeared.,14
DR KENDRICK ON TAPE,"We know the pain of infertility and we are ready to help. In the next half hour, I'll guide you through...",21
SCULLY,Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon's and Simmons' IVF program. It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.,22
MULDER,Maybe now she's trying to erase the results?,8
DR KENDRICK ON TAPE,"... can't guarantee everyone's success, but with our scientific advances, a little luck, and a lot of hope... miracles can happen.",20
SCULLY,"Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders.",12
MULDER,So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against the Stapes Center?,17
SCULLY,"Mulder, does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection? Hello?",10
SCULLY,Hello?,1
SCULLY,Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number.,10
MULDER,I'll tell you what... I'm going to sleep on it and we'll talk about it in the morning.,18
SCULLY,"Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.",8
MULDER,"No, I'm not.",3
SCULLY,You got a girl coming over?,6
MULDER,What's a girl?,3
MULDER,"No, I have... there's a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. See you in the morning.",19
DEEP THROAT,Are you certain she hasn't followed you?,7
MULDER,Yes. What are you doing here?,6
DEEP THROAT,I was hoping we could take in a Warriors game. Actually I was just in the neighborhood... Wondered if I ever told you about the Lichfield Experiments.,27
MULDER,No you haven't.,3
DEEP THROAT,"Well, it was the most interesting project. Highest level of classification. All records have since been destroyed. And those who knew of it, denied knowledge of its existence. It existed during the height of the cold war. We got wind the Russians were fooling around with Eugenics. Rather primitively, I might add. Trying to crossbreed top scientists, athletes... to come up with the superior soldier. Naturally, we jumped on the band wagon.",72
MULDER VOICE OVER,The Lichfield Experiment.,3
DEEP THROAT VOICE OVER,A group of genetically controlled children. Raised and monitored on a compound in Lichfield. The boys were called Adam and the girls were called Eve. There's a woman you should see and I'll make sure that you can get in.,40
MULDER,Agents Mulder and Scully. We're here to see Eve 6.,10
GUARD,Deposit your fire arms.,4
GUARD,Sign for these.,3
MULDER,What are those?,3
GUARD,Panic buttons. Can't let you inside without one.,8
SCULLY,Why the flashlights?,3
GUARD,She screams and screams if we turn the over heads on. No one's ever gotten a good look at her.,20
GUARD,We'll be right outside.,4
MULDER,Hello?,1
EVE 6,Well it looks like you got what you're looking for... One of us at least.,15
SCULLY,Sally Kendrick...,2
EVE 6,Cut off the chains... then we'll talk.,7
MULDER,They're probably there for a good reason.,7
EVE 6,"No. Bad reason. I paid too much attention to a guard. Bit into his eyeball. I meant it as a sign of affection. Are you going to give me an IQ test by any chance? I think I can top 265. We're very bright, we Eves. It runs in the family.",51
MULDER,Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves?,10
EVE 6,"All that's left is me. And Eve 7, she escaped early on. And Eve 8. She escaped 10 years later.",20
SCULLY,Are you Sally Kendrick?,4
EVE 6,That's not my name. But she is me and I am her and we are together.,16
SCULLY,Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine in 1985?,13
EVE 6,"1985?! I've been tied up like this for two years and for what reason? For no reason, I did nothing. I'm just me. They made me. But did they suffer? No. No. I suffer. I suffer! They keep me alive for the Lichfield Project , they come in... they test me, they poke me... to see what went wrong. Sally knows what went wrong.",63
EVE 6,"You and you. You have 46 chromosomes. The Adams and the Eves... we have 56. We have extra chromosomes. Number 4, 5, 12, 16, and 22. This replication of chromosomes also produces additional genes. Heightened strength. Heightened intelligence.",38
MULDER,Heightened psychosis.,2
EVE 6,Saved the best for last. You don't believe me. I have proof. Look on the wall. My family album.,19
SCULLY,My God. It's the girls.,5
EVE 6,We were close. We were very close.,7
MULDER,Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. She was cloning herself.,16
CINDY VOICE OVER,"Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord, my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake... I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Grandma and Grandpa Stenner, Erma and ___, and please bless Mom, and please take care of Daddy up in heaven.",51
MRS REARDON,"You're such a special little girl, Cindy. Good night, Honey.",10
MULDER,Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. That could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time. Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice. Herself.,34
SCULLY,"Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls.",11
MULDER,"No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Teena and Cindy in the family.",26
SCULLY,You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are?,11
MULDER,I hope not.,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, let's go.",3
MULDER,I'll take the back.,4
SCULLY,"There's someone upstairs, wait outside.",5
MULDER,FBI. I'm armed. Eve 7 holding Cindy stops and looks at him. She's wearing a dark sweatshirt with the hood over her head.,23
MULDER,Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8?,9
EVE 7,Drop it. You know I'm capable. Slow. Real slow.,9
SCULLY,"Suspect's name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40's, 5'8, 135 pounds. Now she may have an accomplice, similar in appearance. Kendrick is driving a light blue '93 Corolla. She has exceptional strength for her size. So you must consider her armed and dangerous. Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behavior. The Oakland Bureau was here to orchestrate a search across the bridge.",61
MRS REARDON,What if she kills her?,5
MULDER,"Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice murdered the fathers and abducted the girls means they want them alive. I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.",29
SCULLY,And then what do we do?,6
EVE 7,I'm sorry you have to meet this way. But it's the best for all concerned.,15
EVE 7,"Teena Simmons, meet Cindy Reardon.",5
COP,Agent Scully? They found the Corolla in the parking lot at San Francisco International.,14
SCULLY,"Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single passenger for every flight that left the terminal over the past twelve hours. I want you to check every single terminal to make sure she's not hiding out somewhere for a later flight. And remember, she may have an accomplice.",52
MULDER,That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he's got a guest that matches Sally Kendrick's description.,19
SCULLY,We just found the car at the airport.,8
MULDER,"She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman checked in with a little girl. That she leaves the hotel in the afternoon by herself, was gone all night and returns the next day with the little girl.",39
SCULLY,Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the manager knowing about it. The place is crawling with vacationing families. There would be hundreds of little kids running around.,31
MULDER,"No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine to irradiate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool. Does that sound like someone we know?",27
SCULLY,That's it.,2
EVE 7,I've always kept and close eye on your behavior. No matter where I was. The last few years I've spent in search of the remaining Eves. That however was cut short by your... activity. I hoped my work at the Stapes Center had corrected the Lichfield flaws. Psychotic behavior didn't develop in the Adams and Eves until age 16. Homicidal behavior... at 20. Imagine my... disappointment when I learned of your... accelerated development. How did you know of each other's existence?,81
TEENA AND CINDY,We just knew.,3
EVE 7,Did you discuss how you would orchestrate your little... prank?,10
TEENA AND CINDY,We just knew.,3
EVE 7,Why murder your fathers?,4
THE OTHER ONE,We have no parents.,4
THE FIRST ONE,We weren't born.,3
THE OTHER ONE,We were created.,3
EVE 7,"You cannot think that way. You're human beings. Different, special, but you cannot give into genetic destiny. That's why I've taken you. I was raised by a man who knew what I was. He was a genetic engineer on the project. With the... proper environment, and a program... of long term medication... you can become like me... and not the other Eves...",62
EVE 7,What... what have you done to... me?,7
TEENA OR CINDY,Your soda...,2
THE OTHER ONE,4 ounces of foxglove...,4
THE FIRST ONE,...extracted from the digitalis plant...,5
THE OTHER ONE,This much is a lethal dose.,6
THE FIRST ONE,We cultivated it ourselves.,4
EVE 7,Wh... why?,2
TEENA OR CINDY,You tell us.,3
THE OTHER ONE,You made us.,3
THE FIRST ONE,We're your mistake.,3
EVE 7,That I'll correct... my mistake.,5
COP,I waited like you told me. No one's gotten out and no one's gotten in.,15
COP,Get the back!,3
TEENA OR CINDY,They left.,2
SCULLY,Who's they?,2
OTHER ONE,Her and another lady.,4
FIRST ONE,We were all supposed to drink but we only pretended to drink it.,13
OTHER ONE,They tried to poison us.,5
MULDER,What did the other lady look like?,7
MULDER,Eve 8. They were working together.,6
SCULLY,It's alright. We'll take care of you. You're safe with us.,11
SCULLY,Looks like the Eves mixed about 4 ounces of digitalis in each glass.,13
MULDER,Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.,12
SCULLY,It has a sweet flavor. It's probably not even perceptible in soda.,12
COP,We're still searching the area but still no sign of the other suspect. We'll have an officer take the girls back.,21
MULDER,"Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls.",13
SCULLY,We could take them to get checked out by a doctor.,11
COP,"Okay, whatever.",2
SCULLY,We're going to take you back.,6
CINDY,Back where? What's going to happen to Teena?,8
SCULLY,They've already grown so attached. It's going to be hard when Teena gets placed in foster care.,17
MULDER,Yeah.,1
TEENA OR CINDY,"Agent Mulder, I have to go to the bathroom.",9
OTHER ONE,Me too.,2
MULDER,Can you hold it?,4
FIRST ONE,I really need to go.,5
SCULLY,I could use some caffeine.,5
MULDER,Hi. Where's your bathrooms?,4
WAITRESS,In the back. Let me get you the key.,9
MULDER,Thanks.,1
MULDER,"Oh, can I get four diet sodas?",7
TEENA AND CINDY,Regular.,1
MULDER,"Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please.",9
TEENA OR CINDY VOICE OVER,"Agent Scully, my door's stuck.",5
SCULLY VOICE OVER,Just a second.,3
WAITRESS,Just a minute.,3
TEENA OR CINDY,That's okay. My dad will pay for them when he gets out of the bathroom.,15
MULDER,Those are the diet?,4
TEENA OR CINDY,I think these are.,4
MULDER,Are you sure? These are really sweet.,7
TEENA OR CINDY,I know they are. I saw her pour it.,9
MULDER,Okay.,1
SCULLY,Let's go.,2
MULDER,Come on.,2
TEENA OR CINDY,Don't forget the drinks.,4
MULDER,How much?,2
WAITRESS,$5.,1
MULDER,You want to pay?,4
TEENA OR CINDY,Sure.,1
MULDER,Thanks.,1
SCULLY,"Um, tastes syrupy.",3
MULDER,"You didn't pick up my keys off the counter, did you?",11
MULDER,All right. I'll be right back.,6
MULDER,SCULLY!,1
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,I just wanted to open the car door for you.,10
SCULLY,"Mulder... poisoned them, let's just get them into the car.",10
MULDER,I only had a sip.,5
SCULLY,We didn't drink enough to make us sick.,8
MULDER,SCULLY! I GOT THEM!,4
TEENA AND CINDY,LEAVE US ALONE!,3
MULDER,SCULLY!,1
TRUCK DRIVER,HEY! What the hell are you doing?,7
MULDER,Back off. We're federal agents.,5
TRUCK DRIVER,"Yeah, and these are America's Most Wanted? Hands in front.",10
TEENA AND CINDY,LEAVE US ALONE!,3
TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE,"Get in the truck, girls.",5
TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE,Get in. I'm going to call the police.,8
SCULLY,We are the police.,4
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
TRUCK DRIVER,They went that way.,4
SCULLY,Did you see the twins we were with?,8
WAITRESS,No. There's a bunch of school kids just left in that bus.,12
MULDER,Forget your sodas?,3
TEENA,We didn't do anything wrong.,5
CINDY,We're just little girls.,4
MULDER,That's the last thing you are.,6
MRS REARDON,They said they have an excellent program that can help her.,11
MULDER,"They can't hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have every right to know what happened. You have a right to know about your daughter.",25
MRS REARDON,All I need to know is she was not my daughter. She never was.,14
EVE 6,Hello girls. So nice to have company.,7
GUARD,Sign for this.,3
EVE 9,Hello Eve 8.,3
EVE 8,How did you know I'd come for you?,8
EVE 10,We've been waiting.,3
EVE 8,How did you know I'd come for you?,8
EVE 9,We just knew.,3
EVE 10,We just knew.,3
