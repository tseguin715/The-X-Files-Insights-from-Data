MARGARET SCULLY,"Once, when she was a girl... a very little girl... Dana was in the woods. It was autumn. She had always been a tomboy, unlike her sister Melissa. For her birthday, Dana’s brothers had given her a B.B. gun and were showing her how to use it. Their father had told them only to shoot cans... But in a patch of grass, Bill Jr. found a garter snake. And they began shooting. Wanting to fit in with her brothers, Dana also shot at the snake. It squirmed wildly, desperatly fighting for life but as the boys continued to shoot the snake began to bleed. When she realized what she had done... Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt. Through her tears, she was saying that... something was missing from the snake. She had taken something that was not hers to take. And although deathly afraid of snakes, Dana held the animal as if sheer human will could keep it alive. The snake, its blood on her hands, died. There was nothing she could do to bring it back.",178
MULDER,"It’s too soon, Mrs. Scully. We can’t give up.",9
MARGARET SCULLY,"That day in the woods, I felt for my daughter. But at this moment, I know how my daughter felt.",20
NURSE,"Sir... sir, you can’t go in there!",7
MULDER,Who...? Who brought her here? How did she get here?,10
NURSE,"Sir, will you please...",4
MULDER,How did she get here?,5
NURSE,"Ms. Scully was in this condition when I arrived for the evening shift. If you’ll step outside, perhaps Dr. Daly...",20
MULDER,Is that Daly? Are you Dr. Daly? What’s going on? How the hell did she get here?,17
DOCTOR DALY,Would you settle down...,4
MULDER,"Was it, was it paramedics, FBI, military? Answer me right now!",11
DOCTOR DALY,I...,1
MULDER,"What, you’re telling me she just appeared?",7
DOCTOR DALY,Sir...,1
MULDER,Who did this to her!?,5
DOCTOR DALY,Sir...,1
MULDER,"I want to see her admission forms. Who did this to her? I want to see what tests have been done! Listen, if you’re hiding anything, I swear, I will do anything, whatever it takes, I will find out what they did to her!",44
DOCTOR DALY,"Presently, we have Dana listed under critical condition, comatose. There is complete unawareness of self or environment. There is no evidence of language comprehension, no evidence of voluntary responses to external stimuli. My apologies but... no one here can determine how Dana arrived at the hospital, administered and how she was attended to in such critical condition. Um... because of the absence of Dana’s recent medical history, I am at a loss for prognosis. I can’t determine with certainty how long she’s been in this state.",86
MARGARET SCULLY,You haven’t told us why she’s like this.,8
DOCTOR DALY,"We just don’t know, Mrs. Scully. There are no indications of acute injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic, I can’t find any signs of degenerative or metabolic disorders. We have conducted every test possible.",32
MULDER,I’d like her examined for trace evidence.,7
DOCTOR DALY,"She has been bathed and cleaned since her admittance. Also, there is a situation which I don’t know if you’re aware of. The F.B.I. has notified us of the terms of Dana’s living will.",34
MARGARET SCULLY,"What is it, what did she say?",7
DOCTOR DALY,"Well, Dana is a doctor. Her criteria for terminating life support is quite specific. She states that, um... if her glasgow outcome scale lists her...",25
MULDER,She doesn’t want to live in this condition.,8
DOCTOR DALY,You signed the will as her witness.,7
MELISSA SCULLY,I’ve been told not to call you Fox.,8
MULDER,By who?,2
MELISSA SCULLY,"Dana, just now.",3
MULDER,"Dana talked to you just now? If she talked, the EEG would have moved.",14
MELISSA SCULLY,"Her soul is here. Hi, Mom.",6
MARGARET SCULLY,"I’m glad you could come, Melissa.",6
MULDER,You’re Scully’s sister.,3
MELISSA SCULLY,Dana’s choosing whether... whether to remain or move on. You can feel her. Here.,14
MULDER,She’s not here.,3
MELISSA SCULLY,"No, your anger and your... your fear’s blocking......any positive emotions she needs to feel.",14
MULDER,I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air.,13
NURSE,May I help you?,4
FROHIKE,"Uh, Dana Scully, please.",4
MULDER,Frohike?,1
FROHIKE,"Hey, Mulder. This is weird.",5
BYERS,Good work sneaking out these charts.,6
FROHIKE,Snuck ‘em in my pants.,5
MULDER,There’s plenty of room down there.,6
LANGLY,"You look down, Mulder. Tell you what, you’re welcome to come over Saturday night. We’re all hopping on the internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of ""Earth 2.""",28
MULDER,I’m doing my laundry.,4
BYERS,The chart shows abnormal protein chains in the blood. The amino acid sequence is in a combination I’ve never seen before. I’ve downloaded Scully’s medical data to the newest Lone Gunman.,31
FROHIKE,"He goes by the name ""The Thinker.""",7
BYERS,This guy’s a hacking genius.,5
MULDER,What?,1
BYERS,The Thinker reports the protein chains are a result of branched DNA.,12
MULDER,Branched DNA?,2
LANGLY,The cutting edge of genetic engineering.,6
BYERS,A biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.,7
LANGLY,This is way beyond cutting edge. This technology fifty years down the line.,13
MULDER,What’s it used for?,4
FROHIKE,Could be a tracking system.,5
BYERS,Developmental stages of a biological marker.,6
MULDER,You mean a high-tech identity card?,6
LANGLY,Or something as insidious as grafting a human into something... inhuman.,11
BYERS,"Good theories, gentlemen, but all for naught. This branched DNA is inactive. It’s waste product. Whoever was experimenting on Scully is finished. Now it’s nothing more than a biological poison.",30
MULDER,Will she live?,3
BYERS,"Um... her immune system has been decimated and, uh... I doubt even a healthy human body has the ability to fight this. Mulder, there’s nothing you can do.",28
NURSE OWENS,"Dana? Dana, honey? I know you can hear me. This is Nurse Owens. I’m here to take care of you, sweetheart, to watch over you. Help you find the way home. I know you’re far away from home tonight and that where you are is peaceful. It would be nice to stay but Dana, you must leave here only when it’s time. I’ll be here when you need me, dear.",70
NURSE,"Excuse me, sir. I’m going to have to take some blood. Code blue crash cart!",15
MALE NURSE,Red wave coming in!,4
NURSE,Let’s go!,2
DOCTOR,"Alright, let’s get an airway in!",6
NURSE,B.P. 80 over 60 and dropping.,6
DOCTOR,"Alright, let’s shock her. Give me the paddles. 200 joules. Clear!",11
NURSE,Clear!,1
DOCTOR,What do we got?,4
NURSE,nan,1
DOCTOR,"Let’s go again, 260, clear!",5
NURSE,Clear!,1
DOCTOR,Come on!,2
MULDER,Hey!,1
X,Didn’t expect you here till after visiting hours.,8
MULDER,"There was a man, he took Scully’s blood.",8
X,Forget him.,2
MULDER,Get that gun out of my face...,7
X,This high-capacity compact Sig Saver .40 caliber weapon is pointed at your head to stress my insistence that your search for who put your partner on that respirator desist immediately!,30
MULDER,You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what you say? You go to hell!,20
X,"You got him killed! You got her killed. That’s not going to happen to me. You’re my tool, you understand? I come to you when I need you. Right now, you’re heading in a direction that can lead them right here.",41
MULDER,What the hell are you talking about?,7
X,You’re not supposed to know. That’s the point.,8
MULDER,I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing.,10
X,"She was a good soldier, Mulder, but there’s nothing you can do to bring her back.",16
MULDER,She’s not dead.,3
X,"Listen to you. Listen. You’re a damn schoolboy, Mulder. You have no idea. No idea!",15
MULDER,"Okay, then tell me. Tell me!",6
X,"I used to be you. I was where you are now. But you’re not me, Mulder. I don’t think you have the heart. Walk away. Grieve for Scully and then never look back. You will be able to live with yourself, Mulder... on the day you die.",47
MULDER,"Federal agent! Federal agent, don’t turn around. You know I’m armed. Put your gun very slowly on the ground. Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers. Turn right towards the machine and put your head on it. Face me. Who wants this? Who wants it? All right, let’s go. This way.",54
X,Stay there.,2
MULDER,Wait!,1
X,"You want to see what it takes to find the truth, Agent Mulder? You want to know what I know? I’ll attend to this.",24
DOCTOR DALY,"Discontinuing the respirator does not necessarily mean pulling the plug or ending her life. Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years after cessation of mechanical ventilation. I do believe, however, that this is not the case with your daughter, Mrs. Scully. My guess is that she’s been in this state since her disappearance and she will not improve.",58
MELISSA SCULLY,Is she below the criteria established in her will?,9
MULDER,It’s possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics.,10
DOCTOR DALY,"Agent Mulder, I don’t know where you developed this bizarre diagnosis, but I do believe you’re in no position to continue your...",22
MULDER,You’ve never provided an answer as to why she’s here or what’s wrong with her. We need to study her.,20
MELISSA SCULLY,She’s not a piece of evidence.,6
MULDER,She’s here because of unnatural circumstances.,6
MELISSA SCULLY,"She’s dying. That’s perfectly natural. We hide people in these rooms because we don’t want to look at death. We have machines prolong a life that should, that should end. That’s a much more unnatural circumstance than any cause of her death.",42
MULDER,That’s very politically correct.,4
MELISSA SCULLY,That’s very human. I love her. This is right.,9
MARGARET SCULLY,"Dana has made our decision. Fox... you and Dana had a friendship built on respect. Now, in the last year... I have lost my husband. And God knows I don’t want to lose my baby girl. But like you, I have always respected her. Fox... this is a moment for the family. But you can join us if you want.",60
CSM,"Read it. It’s all there. If you’re having trouble sitting on Mulder, Assistant Director Skinner, I’m sure you know we’d have no trouble.",23
SKINNER,"Uh-uh. Yeah, come in. Sit down. I called you right up here because of rumors about an incident at the hospital last night.",23
MULDER,Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria jello?,12
SKINNER,The rumor has it that you were involved in the laundry room?,12
MULDER,"No, sir.",2
SKINNER,"A man was executed, Agent Mulder.",6
MULDER,I was with Scully.,4
SKINNER,Traces of her blood were found at the scene.,9
MULDER,May I see the police report?,6
SKINNER,"There is no police report of this incident, Agent Mulder, and there is no body. You know that.",18
MULDER,"Since I am unfamiliar with any such incident, sir, no, how would I know that?",15
SKINNER,Knock it off!,3
MULDER,"How’s it feel? Constant denial of everything, questions answered with a question.",12
SKINNER,"I want to know what happened, damn it.",8
MULDER,Him. That’s what happened. Cancer Man! He’s responsible for what happened to Scully!,13
SKINNER,How do you know that?,5
MULDER,It’s a rumor. Who is he?,6
SKINNER,It’s not your...,3
MULDER,"Oh, you can have it all, you can have my badge, you can have the X-Files, just tell me where he is.",22
SKINNER,"And then what? He sleeps with the fishes? We’re not the mafia, Agent Mulder. I know it’s easy to forget but we work for the Department of Justice.",28
MULDER,That’s what I want.,4
SKINNER,"Agent Scully was a fine officer. More than that, I liked her. I respected her. We all know the field we play on and we all know what can happen in the course of a game. If you were unprepared for all the potentials, then you shouldn’t step on the field.",51
MULDER,What if I... I knew the potential consequences but I... I never told her?,14
SKINNER,"Then you’re as much to blame for her condition as... ""The Cancer Man.""",13
WILLIAM SCULLY,"Hello, Starbuck. It’s Ahab. People would say to me, ""Life is short."" ""Kids, they grow up fast,"" and ""Before you know it, it’s over."" I never listened. For me, life went at a proper pace. There were many rewards... until the moment that I knew, I... understood that... that I would never see you again... my little girl. Then my life felt as if it had been the length of one breath, one heartbeat. I never knew how much I loved my daughter until I could never tell her. At that moment, I would have traded every medal, every commendation, every promotion for... one more second with you. We’ll be together again, Starbuck. But not now. Soon.",117
NURSE OWENS,"Dana? I know death is at arm’s reach tonight, but Dana? Your time is not over.",16
MELISSA SCULLY,"You know, Fox… sorry, Mulder... you could spend the rest of your life finding every person who’s responsible and it’s still not going to bring her back. Whoever did this to her has an equal horror coming to them.",39
MULDER,Including myself?,2
WOMAN,"Pardon me, sir, do you have change for the cigarette machine?",11
MULDER,"No. Sorry, I don’t.",4
MELISSA SCULLY,"What do you mean, yourself?",5
WOMAN,There’s a pack already here... Morley’s. Not my brand.,9
MAN ON TV,"Want a cigarette, Rev? How ‘bout a smoke?",8
MULDER,Sit down!,2
CSM,How’d you find me?,4
MULDER,"Shut up! Tonight, I ask the questions! You’re going to answer me, you son of a bitch!",17
CSM,"Don’t try and threaten me, Mulder. I’ve watched presidents die.",10
MULDER,Why her? Why her and not me? Answer me!,9
CSM,I like you. I like her too. That’s why she was returned to you.,14
MULDER,You should be the one to die.,7
CSM,"Why? Look at me. No wife, no family, some power. I’m in the game because I believe what I’m doing is right.",22
MULDER,Right? Who are you to decide what’s right?,8
CSM,"Who are you? If people were to know the things I know, it would all fall apart. I told Skinner you shot the man in the hospital but I didn’t really believe it. And here you are with a gun to my head. I have more respect for you, Mulder. You’re becoming a player. You can kill me now, but you’ll never know the truth......and that’s why I’ll win. Don’t worry. This’ll be our secret. We wouldn’t want others to… start rumors.",82
SKINNER,"When I started out, this is where they kept the copier.",11
MULDER,"At least back then, it wasn’t just wasted space.",9
SKINNER,"It’s unacceptable. Look, I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully, but I will not accept resignation and defeat as self-punishment.",21
MULDER,"All the forensics, the field investigations, the eyewitness accounts... to still know nothing. To lose myself... and Scully. I hate what I’ve become.",23
SKINNER,"When I was eighteen, I, uh... I went to Vietnam. I wasn’t drafted, Mulder, I... I enlisted in the Marine Corps the day of my eighteenth birthday. I did it on a blind faith. I did it because I believed it was the right thing to do. I don’t know, maybe I still do. Three weeks into my tour, a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy walked into camp covered with grenades and I, uh... I blew his head off from a distance of ten yards. I lost my faith. Not in my country or in myself, but in everything. There was just no point to anything anymore. One night on patrol, we were, uh... caught... and everyone... everyone fell. I mean, everyone. I looked down... at my body... from outside of it. I didn’t recognize it at first. I watched the V.C. strip my uniform, take my weapon and I remained... in this thick jungle... peaceful... unafraid... watching my... my dead friends. Watching myself. In the morning, the corpsmen arrived and put me in a bodybag until... I guess they found a pulse. I woke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later. I’m afraid to look any further beyond that experience. You? You are not. Your resignation is unacceptable.",208
MULDER,You. You gave me Cancer Man’s location. You put your life in danger.,13
SKINNER,"Agent Mulder, every life, everyday is in danger. That’s just life.",11
X,Your plane ticket.,3
MULDER,But we barely know each other.,6
X,I can’t tell you why she was taken. It’s too close to me. I’m giving you the men who took her.,21
MULDER,How?,1
X,They believe you’ll be out of town. They believe you information they’ll search your apartment. They will be armed. You will be waiting.,23
MULDER,Waiting.,1
X,"To defend yourself with terminal intensity. It’s the only way, Mulder. The law will not punish these people. After tonight, we cannot make contact for several weeks.",27
MELISSA SCULLY,Mulder. Sorry. I came by. You weren’t answering and your machine wasn’t on. Can I come in? For a second? Why is it so dark in here?,27
MULDER,Because the lights aren’t on.,5
MELISSA SCULLY,Okay. I just came from the hospital. Dr. Daly says... she’s weakening. It could be anytime. So I figured you’d want to come down and see her.,27
MULDER,"No, I can’t.",3
MELISSA SCULLY,"Well, I’d think that you would.",6
MULDER,"Yeah, I would. I can’t, not right now.",8
MELISSA SCULLY,Listen. I don’t have to be psychic to see that you’re in a very dark place... much darker than where my sister is. Willingly walking deeper into darkness cannot help her at all. Only the light...,36
MULDER,"Enough with the harmonic convergence crap, okay? You’re not saying anything to me.",13
MELISSA SCULLY,"Why don’t you just drop your cynicism and your paranoia and your defeat. You know, just because it’s positive and good doesn’t make it silly or trite! Why is it so much easier for you to run around trying to get even than just expressing to her how you feel? I expect more from you. Dana expects more. Even if it doesn’t bring her back, at least she’ll know. And so will you.",73
MULDER,"I feel, Scully... that you believe... you’re not ready to go. And you’ve always had the strength of your beliefs. I don’t know if my being here... will help bring you back. But I’m here.",35
NURSE AT DESK,I’ll look at the chart.,5
NURSE,"Call Dr. Daly, now.",4
MULDER ON ANSWERING MACHINE,"Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message...",8
MULDER,I’m here.,2
MARGARET SCULLY,"Hello, Fox.",2
SCULLY,"Not Fox, Mulder.",3
MULDER,How you feeling?,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, I don’t remember anything... after Duane Barry...",8
MULDER,"Doesn’t... doesn’t matter. Brought you a present. ""Superstars of the Super Bowl.""",12
SCULLY,I knew there was a reason to live.,8
MULDER,"I know you want to get some rest, I... just came by to see... how you were doing and say hi.",21
SCULLY,Mulder? I had the strength of your beliefs.,8
MULDER,I was holding this for you.,6
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
SCULLY,Hmm. Could I see Nurse Owens? I’ve got something I’d like her to have.,14
NURSE,Nurse who?,2
SCULLY,Owens. Short with straight light brown hair? She watched over me in intensive care and I’d like to thank her.,20
NURSE,"Dana, I’ve worked here for ten years and there’s no Nurse Owens at this hospital.",15
