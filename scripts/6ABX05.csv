MORRIS,"Once upon a time, there was a guy with the improbable name of Fox Mulder. He started out life happily enough, as these things go. He had parents who loved him, a cute kid sister. He had a roof over his head, got all his flu shots, had all his fingers and toes and aside from being stuck with the name ""Fox"" which probably taught him how to fight-- or not-- he pretty much led a normal life. But the worst thing by far-- the biggest kick in the slacks this kid Fox ever got-- was what happened to his sister. One day, she just disappeared.",106
MORRIS,"Now, Fox buckled down and worked his butt off. Graduated top of his class at Oxford then top of his class at the FBI academy. None of that hard work made up for his sister, though. It was just a way of putting her out of his mind. Finally, the way I figure it, he went out of his mind and he's been that way ever since. Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career, lost the respect of supervisors and friends and now lives his life shaking his fist at the sky and muttering about conspiracies to anyone who will listen. If you ask me, he's one step away from pushing a baby carriage filled with tin cans down the street. But now, all that's going to change.",128
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Tell them the truth, you lying son of a bitch! He's not me, Scully! Scully! Scully, he's not me!",19
MORRIS AS MULDER,"You hate me now, right? Dana, I'm sorry I naked on you to Kersh, but I...I was scared you were going to lose your job.",25
SCULLY,"You did the right thing, Mulder.",6
MORRIS AS MULDER,I did?,2
SCULLY,"I've been telling you for years you should play more by the book, haven't I?",15
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Hey, it's the new me.",5
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey... Hey, fellas, take... What about these? Come on, fellas.",10
LANA CHEE/PILOT,"You ain't going nowhere, mibby. You and me have had our asses officially disappeared. Looks like we're up fudge creek.",20
MULDER AS MORRIS,Who are you?,3
LANA CHEE/PILOT,Call sign's Maverick. Not like I'm going to be hot- sticking it anytime soon,14
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Are you all right, Ma'am?",5
LANA CHEE/PILOT,"""Ma'am?"" Kiss my ass, you desk monkey.",7
MORRIS AS MULDER,"No, no, no. Up, up... Whew. I am Tiger Woods.",10
MORRIS AS MULDER,"So, what did Kersh say?",5
SCULLY,"He said that I was willful, insubordinate and not a team player and the FBI didn't need agents that weren't team players.",22
MORRIS AS MULDER,What a jerk. Then what?,5
SCULLY,Two-week suspension without pay.,4
MORRIS AS MULDER,You're not serious. Who does he think he is?,9
SCULLY,See you in two weeks.,5
MORRIS AS MULDER,Dana? You suppose a home-cooked meal might ease the pain,10
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Think she likes me, Tiger.",5
LANA CHEE/PILOT,"So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears Rio flying back seat and I'm thinking, hell, man I'm going to give this cherry the ride of his life."" So I'm putting the spurs to her, you know? And I'm doing a little hassling with my wingman, Buzzsaw. Now, Buzzsaw...",48
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey, Maverick would you mind?",5
LANA CHEE/PILOT,Hold up. Buzzsaw gets on my zero. He's right on my zero. And when Buzzsaw gets on your zero...,19
MULDER AS MORRIS,Maverick...?,1
LANA CHEE/PILOT,...he's like a damn dog tick.,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,Maverick?,1
LANA CHEE/PILOT,You ain't shaking that son of a gun.,8
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey, Grandma Top Gun, will you shut the hell up?!",10
LANA CHEE/PILOT,You're my bitch now pencil-neck.,5
GUARD,General Wegman wants to see you.,6
GENERAL WEGMAN,Son... You got a set on you. I'll say that much.,11
JEFF,You had us fooled. Why didn't you tell us what you were doing from the start?,16
MULDER AS MORRIS,Meaning?,1
GENERAL WEGMAN,It's the wrong one. You replaced the flight data recorder. This one's from...,13
HOWARD,"A scrapped F-111, sir. It's junk. You gave the FBI the wrong flight data recorder. Why?",16
JEFF,"Morry, if you were running a scam on the FBI why didn't you let us in on it?",18
MULDER AS MORRIS,"I didn't know if I could trust you. We have a security leak, gentlemen and for all I knew it was one of you. That's why I decided I should approach Agent Scully alone to find out who her contact is. Unfortunately, her partner Agent Mulder screwed everything up.",49
HOWARD,So why didn't you tell us all this afterward?,9
MULDER AS MORRIS,I knew that you wouldn't believe it until you figured it out for yourself.,14
HOWARD,So the real flight data recorder is safe?,8
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Oh, yeah. Absolutely.",3
HOWARD,And you will bring it back?,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,Of course.,2
GENERAL WEGMAN,"By God, you do got a set on you. I wish I could say the same about some of your colleagues. About those who proffer rumor and innuendo those who make dangerous accusations.",33
HOWARD,"Sir, Morris's behavior seemed to....",5
GENERAL WEGMAN,You can explain yourself to the review panel in Washington. I've already wired them recommending censure for your actions. You're lucky I didn't throw you in the stockade.,28
MORRIS AS MULDER,Uh-huh.,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,A little mood lighting for the bedroom. No bedroom.,9
MORRIS AS MULDER,This guy hasn't been laid in ten years.,8
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey, Chris. Hey, I like the, uh... The, uh... The nose...",11
CHRIS,Ouch! As if.,3
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Terry. Buddy. Hey, Terence. Sorry. How's it going?",8
TERRY,Mom says she's taking out a restraining order on you.,10
JOANNE MORRIS,What are you doing back?,5
MULDER AS MORRIS,Joanne...,1
JOANNE MORRIS,Your stuff is all outside. Take it and get out.,10
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Joanne, listen to me. There's something I got to tell you.",11
JOANNE MORRIS,"I've heard enough from you for one lifetime, Morris. Go tell it to that tramp of yours, that Scully, whatshername.",20
MULDER AS MORRIS,Dana Scully- Special Agent Dana Scully.,6
JOANNE MORRIS,Special Tramp Dana Scully.,4
MULDER AS MORRIS,"She's my partner, Joanne.",4
JOANNE MORRIS,I'm supposed to be your partner.,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,"My name is not Morris Fletcher. It's Fox Mulder. Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. Dana Scully is my FBI partner. I am not your husband we are not married, we are complete strangers and I have a whole other life that I'm desperately trying to get back to.",50
JOANNE MORRIS,"You know, Morris most men when they have a mid-life crisis they go out and buy themselves a sports car. They don't run around calling themselves Fox.",27
MULDER AS MORRIS,"I want you to look out the window. Will you just look out the window with me for a second? See that car down there? See the two men in it? They're surveilling me. They're spying on me. I don't know if your husband ever told you this but he has a very dangerous job and those two men in that car, like you, think that I'm him only they don't trust me. So, one false move and I'm history. Which means that your husband will also be history because I won't be able to get back and set things the way they're supposed to be. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?",114
JOANNE MORRIS,"Morris, if you don't like the man you've become I don't blame you one bit. But this flight from reality isn't the answer. Accept who you are. However repulsive that may be.",32
MORRIS AS MULDER,Perfect timing. Welcome.,3
SCULLY,Wow. Mulder.,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,"You like, huh? Yeah, I thought it was time I stopped living like a frat boy. Come on and see the rest of the place. Over there.",27
SCULLY,I didn't even know you had a bedroom.,8
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, got to have someplace to lounge around and read the Sunday New York times, you know.",19
SCULLY,"Uh, no, that's okay. Thanks.",5
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Seriously, just check it out. Seriously.",6
SCULLY,Oh!,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,Whoa! Uh-oh.,2
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER AS MORRIS AS MULDER,Maybe I like to read the New York Times backwards.,10
MORRIS AS MULDER,Do you hate it?,4
SCULLY,"No, I don't hate it.",5
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Well, all right then. Uh, don't go away.",8
MORRIS AS MULDER,Let's get it on Let's get it on Let's get it on Let's get it on Tonight is the night...,20
SCULLY,",Do you know what would really be fun?",8
MORRIS AS MULDER,What?,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh, yeah. Me first?",4
SCULLY,You first.,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,First time. Now what?,4
SCULLY,You're not Mulder.,3
MORRIS AS MULDER,What?,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,Baby...,1
SCULLY,"""Baby"" me and you'll be peeing through a catheter. Your name is Morris Fletcher. It was Mulder who was arrested in the desert. He was telling the truth about you. Now, how do we get things back to normal?",39
MORRIS AS MULDER,"How should I know? I wouldn't do it even if I could. You saw my wife. Do you think I want to go back to that? Two kids who'd probably kill me in my sleep for the insurance money. A $400,000 mortgage on a house that just appraised at $226,000. And my job... Yee-gods. You think being a man in black is all voodoo mind control? I can see the paperwork.",71
SCULLY,Are you through?,3
MORRIS AS MULDER,"As far as I'm concerned this thing is a gift from heaven. Besides, no one is ever going to believe you so you might as well just get used to me being here.",33
SCULLY,Or I just shoot you... Baby.,6
MORRIS AS MULDER,"I'm telling you, I have no idea how to change things back.",12
SCULLY,What about Mulder's source? The man he was supposed to meet in the desert? What about him? Do you know how to get in touch with him?,27
MORRIS AS MULDER,I don't know anything about that. Sorry. You're out of luck.,11
ANSWERING MACHINE,"Hello, hello. I'm very busy entertaining a *special* guest. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.",18
MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE,"Agent Mulder, I'm trying you one last time. Are you or are you not interested in the classified information I have to give you? Please pick up the phone if you're there.",32
MORRIS AS MULDER,Mulder.,1
MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE,"Agent Mulder, listen very carefully.",5
JOANNE MORRIS,"Well, I guess we've given the neighbors enough to talk about. For God's sake, Morris at first you couldn't wait to get away from me and now you won't leave the house.",32
MULDER AS MORRIS,Where can we go?,4
JOANNE MORRIS,What do you mean?,4
MULDER AS MORRIS,You're right. We should get out of the house. Go someplace with a lot of people.,16
JOANNE MORRIS,Someplace with a lot of people?,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,Mm-hmm.,1
JOANNE MORRIS,"In Rachel, Nevada?",3
MULDER AS MORRIS,What do you say?,4
MORRIS AS MULDER,"All right, let's run through this one more time. I'll go in there alone, just like you told me to. He'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap.",28
SCULLY,And?,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,And if I try and slip out the back door da-da-da-dee-dee-dee.,11
SCULLY,Get going.,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Can't we start over? You know, do that thing with the handcuffs?",12
MORRIS AS MULDER,Probably not your scene.,4
COUNTRY MUSIC ON JUKEBOX,"I have waited for what seems Like a whole light-year Just to see your face Once again, my dear Shiny brown-eyed moonlight, Sunlight, starlight With big dark eyes That send me out of sight Now I'm staring At the stars...",40
JOANNE MORRIS,Are you expecting someone?,4
MULDER AS MORRIS,"No, I'm not expecting someone.",5
JOANNE MORRIS,"Because if you're here expecting someone and not to buy me a drink, you should tell me now so I can divorce you and take the house.",27
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Joanne, have another white wine. Staring at the stars Wondering where you are...",13
MORRIS AS MULDER,You're the guy?!,3
GENERAL WEGMAN,Sit down.,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Well, I'll be damned.",4
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Whoa, ooh, that beer, it went right through me. I got to... I'll be right back.",16
MORRIS AS MULDER,You sabotaged a UFO?,4
GENERAL WEGMAN,"Keep your voice down. I didn't intend for it to crash, Agent Mulder. I just meant to disable the stealth module so you could see it.",26
MULDER AS MORRIS,Scully.,1
SCULLY,Mulder? Is that really you?,5
MULDER AS MORRIS,What are you doing here?,5
SCULLY,I'm trying to figure out a way to help you.,10
MORRIS AS MULDER,"What, are you, like, disgruntled?",5
GENERAL WEGMAN,"You make me sound like some postal clerk. What you came for is on the floor by your feet. Starlight, star bright...",22
JOANNE MORRIS,"Morris? In my memory you are moonlight, starlight With big dark eyes that Send me out of sight Now I'm staring at the stars Wondering where you are Wondering if I'll ever see Your face again Now I'm staring at the stars Wondering where you are...",46
JEFF,"Joanne? Hey, how's it going? Listen, have you seen Morry?",10
JOANNE MORRIS,You bet I've seen him.,5
JEFF,"Hey, hey, whoa, guys. Guys. What the hell was that, Morry?",11
MULDER AS MORRIS,I guess I make a lousy husband.,7
JEFF,I'll talk to her.,4
MULDER AS MORRIS,So you're the guy that wants my life. I assume that includes all the ass-kickings.,15
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh, no... You don't want to do this.",8
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Yeah, I do.",3
MORRIS AS MULDER,Jeff's outside.,2
MULDER AS MORRIS,So what?,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,"If he sees us together, we're both dead. Especially when he sees this.",13
MULDER AS MORRIS,You take that to Scully right now.,7
MORRIS AS MULDER,You must have some sort of waxy buildup. I said Jeff's here. No way am I going out there until he leaves. You sneak it past him. You're his buddy.,30
MULDER AS MORRIS,His buddy? He doesn't trust me as far as he can throw me. You saw to that.,17
GENERAL WEGMAN,"Oh, geez.",2
MULDER AS MORRIS,Hey.,1
GENERAL WEGMAN,Hey....as long as the sun would shine You would love me Love me And I hope You'll love the sunshine One more time...,23
(SHORT TIME LATER,GENERAL WEGMAN exits the bathroom observed by SCULLY and JEFF.),10
GENERAL WEGMAN,Jeff.,1
JEFF,General Wegman.,2
GENERAL WEGMAN,"You men, come with me.",5
JEFF,"Sir... What are we, uh...?",5
GENERAL WEGMAN,There. Detain that man.,4
JEFF,Morris... Stop.,2
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey, guys.",2
JEFF,"What's in the bag, Morris?",5
MULDER AS MORRIS,"It's, uh... Beer.",3
GENERAL WEGMAN,You sure it's not a flight data recorder?,8
MULDER AS MORRIS,"No, it's beer.",3
MORRIS AS MULDER,Suckers.,1
LANGLY,Mmm. More huevos rancheros.,4
FROHIKE,Mas huevos rancheros.,3
BYERS,Por favor.,2
SCULLY,Open up.,2
FROHIKE,Mulder... If I'd known you were coming I would have made more salsa.,13
SCULLY,We need your help right now.,6
LANGLY,Who crashed?,2
SCULLY,"Who, what, why. I need to know everything that's on that data recorder.",13
BYERS,It's similar in size and shape to the FDRs on the SR-71.,12
FROHIKE,"Well, that's definitely not standard issue.",6
BYERS,Where did you get this?,5
SCULLY,Groom Lake. Outside Area 51.,5
FROHIKE,Dreamland.,1
LANGLY,The Aurora spy plane.,4
SCULLY,What's that?,2
FROHIKE,"Black world. Top, top secret. A skunkworks special.",8
BYERS,Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft fueled with slush- hydrogen.,10
LANGLY,Or methylcyclohexane.,2
FROHIKE,What's with him?,3
MORRIS AS MULDER,"You guys like the name? I'm going to go with either ""Aurora"" or ""Borealis.""",14
FROHIKE,What the hell's he talking about?,6
BYERS,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,He's not Mulder.,3
LANGLY,Huh?,1
SCULLY,"We think the crash of this particular aircraft-- whatever it was-- resulted in a, uh...",15
MORRIS AS MULDER,My name is Morris Fletcher. I work inside Area 51. I assumed Mulder's identity through a warp in the space-time continuum.,21
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Trust me, little man, I ain't him. Oh, I love you guys. I really do. I mean, you're the ""Lone Gunmen,"" aren't you? You guys are my heroes. I mean, look at this crap you print.",36
BYERS,We uncover the truth.,4
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh, the truth. Well, see that's what's so great about you monkeys. Not only do you believe this horse pucky that we create you broadcast it as well. I mean, look at this.",33
MORRIS AS MULDER,There is no Saddam Hussein. This guy's name is John Gillnitz. We found him doing dinner theater in Tulsa. Did a mean King and I. Plays good ethnics.,28
LANGLY,You're trying to say that Saddam Hussein's a government plant?,10
MORRIS AS MULDER,I'm saying I invented the guy. We set him up in '79. He rattles his saber whenever we need a good distraction. Ah... If you boys only knew how many of your stories I dreamed up while sitting on the pot.,41
FROHIKE,What stories?,2
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh, I'm sorry, Melvin, that's classified.",6
FROHIKE,"The name's Frohike, you punk ass. What the hell you do with Mulder?",13
SCULLY,"Shut up, all of you. If you guys want Mulder back, get me these results.",15
GENERAL WEGMAN,Who is it?,3
MULDER AS MORRIS,Morris Fletcher.,2
GENERAL WEGMAN,Come in. We shouldn't be seen together. Not after last night. Fletcher... Mulder... Whoever you are.,16
MULDER AS MORRIS,I'm hoping this'll be our last meeting. Agent Scully's flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder.,19
GENERAL WEGMAN,It'll be too late to save me.,7
MULDER AS MORRIS,I know. The real Morris Fletcher knows you're the leak.,10
GENERAL WEGMAN,Once you get back-- if you get back-- he'll have me arrested. Disappeared. Even if he doesn't his colleagues will figure out soon enough I sabotaged that craft.,28
MULDER AS MORRIS,Why'd you do it?,4
GENERAL WEGMAN,I didn't mean for it to crash. I just wanted you to see it.,14
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Well, why?",2
GENERAL WEGMAN,"There comes a time when you... look back instead of forward... See the sum of your life. My entire career has been spent hiding the truth from the American people destroying, in a way, that which was most precious to me.",41
MULDER AS MORRIS,What is the truth?,4
GENERAL WEGMAN,You mean... You don't know?,5
MULDER AS MORRIS,Don't know what?,3
GENERAL WEGMAN,The truth - what *is* going on here at Area 51? What are these black-budget projects? We just fly these birds. They don't tell us what makes them go. They engineer them all up in Utah.,35
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Well, if you don't know, why'd you call me?",9
GENERAL WEGMAN,"Well, I... I've seen your file. You've chased flying saucers for years. Do aliens really exist, Agent Mulder?",18
FROHIKE,Something's coming up.,3
BYERS,Got it.,2
SCULLY,What is it?,3
BYERS,We broke the encryption.,4
LANGLY,"This baby records the telemetry of 28 systems including airspeed, fuselage torque and delta-v.",14
FROHIKE,"Yeah, all the usual readouts, but, uh... What are these?",10
BYERS,Tachyon flux... Gravitational displacement.,4
FROHIKE,"""Aurora,"" my ass. What have you guys been flying out there?",11
SCULLY,"All right, I want you guys to analyze that data. Morris...",11
MORRIS AS MULDER,This is one of mine.,5
SCULLY,Get your butt in gear.,5
MORRIS AS MULDER,You're going to miss me when I'm gone.,8
FROHIKE,"Fat chance, laughing boy.",4
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Back off, sneezy.",3
SCULLY,Enough. Call me when you guys have some answers.,9
GUY 1,"Ah, far out. The black mailbox.",6
GUY 2,"Dude, that's a white mailbox.",5
GUY 1,"No, they painted it white to hide it. This is the black mailbox. The best place to see Freedom Mountain and the UFOs over Dreamland, man. I know a guy who saw five in one night. He said they danced in the sky. You guys hear that? What the hell? Cool. Did you guys see that?",56
MULDER AS MORRIS,You don't look too happy. Don't tell me I'm going to have to put two kids through school.,18
SCULLY,"That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?",8
SCULLY,"I, uh... I just got off the phone with Frohike. They were able to download and analyze the crash data and, yes, there was an anomalous event that night.",29
MULDER AS MORRIS,And how do I get back?,6
SCULLY,"Well, that's just it. It's all about random moments in time... About a series of variables approaching an event horizon. And even if we... could recreate that moment if we could sabotage another craft... Mulder, if we were... If we were off... If the event were off by even one millisecond...",51
MULDER AS MORRIS,I might wind up with my head in a rock.,10
SCULLY,"Something like that, yeah.",4
MULDER AS MORRIS,"What about him? I mean, me. Whatever. Whoever he is.",10
SCULLY,Agent Mulder has become AD Kersh's new golden boy. He's been tasked with returning the flight data recorder that he and I stole. The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh even more than I do to my priest. I'm just tagging along for the ride.,46
MULDER AS MORRIS,"What do you mean, ""just tagging along""?",7
SCULLY,I'm out of the Bureau. I've been censured and relieved of my position.,13
MULDER AS MORRIS,No. You can explain it to them like you explained it to me. You have the data. You can make them understand. You can get your job back.,28
SCULLY,I'd kiss you if you weren't so damn ugly.,9
MORRIS AS MULDER,Take a picture-- it'll last longer.,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,If I... shoot him is that murder or suicide?,9
SCULLY,"Neither, if I do it first.",6
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Hey, Scully...",2
GUY 1,"Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! You got to help me! You got to help me! Open the window! Please, open your window!",22
GUY 1,"I need to talk to you! Please, I need somebody to help me. It's this thing... It was like, like, like a wave... Like all squiggly and everything... And... And their faces, they, they stuck together! And, and, and her arm-- it was coming through his chest!",47
GUY 2,"Sam, man, where you been? Who's the dude?",8
GUY 1,"I swear, man... They were messed up.",7
HOWARD,I believe you.,3
MORRIS AS MULDER,"So the motel guy wants cash. Won't take credit card-- do FBI."" I tell him we're investigating crappy motels in the Southwest. He'd better watch his behind. So guess what? The guy gives me the room for free and he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot. I love this job! Listen, Dana, after we return this flight recorder what do you say I have a word with the big man-- see if I can get you your job back? We could have lots of fun together once you got to know me. You know I'd change.",98
SCULLY,I've still got my gun.,5
MORRIS AS MULDER,"All right, already.",3
SCULLY,"Wait a second, hold on. Back up.",7
MORRIS AS MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,Back up.,2
PREVIOUSLY RUDE ATTENDANT,"Can I help you, ma'am?",5
SCULLY,I don't understand. This-this place was burnt to the ground.,10
PREVIOUSLY RUDE ATTENDANT,I don't think so.,4
SCULLY,"Yeah... This place, two nights ago.",6
PREVIOULSLY RUDE ATTENDANT,I think I'd remember that.,5
LANA CHEE/PILOT,What's going on?,3
MULDER AS MORRIS,What are you doing here?,5
SCULLY,I need to talk to you. Something's happened.,8
JOANNE MORRIS,"Morris! Don't forget your stupid chair! You and it should be very happy together! Terence, get back inside. You got a lot of gall coming back here, sister",28
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Joanne, I told you-- I'm not your husband. This man is.",11
JOANNE MORRIS,You come here to watch my family fall apart? You getting some kind of big kick out of that?,19
SCULLY,I have to talk to you alone.,7
JOANNE MORRIS,Homewrecker!,1
MORRIS AS MULDER,Careful. You're going to bust a lung.,7
JOANNE MORRIS,Leave me alone.,3
MORRIS AS MULDER,Joanne... What he said about me being your husband-- it's true.,11
JOANNE MORRIS,Get the hell off my porch.,6
MORRIS AS MULDER,"We got married on June 13, 1978. It rained that day. You got mad at me at the reception because I said couldn't see the cake behind your fat ass. Remember our first apartment-- that dump in Pentagon City? You'd turn the air conditioner on and the lights would go out? Or when you were pregnant how I'd tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh? Remember? Remember the night Chrissy was born? When I held her in my arms all red-faced and screaming?",83
JOANNE MORRIS,"That was the only time I ever saw you cry. Oh, my god... Morris? Is that you?",17
MULDER AS MORRIS,"Come on, Morris. Let's go.",5
JOANNE MORRIS,"What do you mean, go? Where are you taking him?",10
SCULLY,"Mrs. Fletcher, we have reason to believe that whatever event caused this to happen may be in the process of reversing.",21
MULDER AS MORRIS,"We got to get back to that highway, back to the exact spot where this all began. It may be our only chance.",23
JEFF,"Sorry, Morris. A traitor's a traitor.",6
MULDER AS MORRIS,This isn't what it looks like.,6
SOLDIER,Got it!,2
SOLDIER,Sir.,1
JEFF,What are you doing?,4
HOWARD,I'm cleaning up a mess.,5
JEFF,What are you talking about?,5
HOWARD,About an hour ago I put Captain McDonough and Mrs. Chee back where they belong. Now it's their turn.,19
MULDER AS MORRIS,The warp that started this is snapping back like a rubber band.,12
SCULLY,Only we have to be in its path when it happens.,11
MULDER,Why are you doing this?,5
HOWARD,"Till now, I had a spotless career record. I want that back.",12
MORRIS AS MULDER,So this is time snapping back?,6
MULDER AS MORRIS,It'll be like the last few days never happened. You won't remember any of this.,15
MORRIS AS MULDER,"Oh. Well, in that case, Dana... It's been real.",9
SCULLY,"Come on, Mulder. Let's go.",5
MULDER,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me. I just wanted to let you know that we slipped under Kersh's radar. Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed.",24
MULDER,"Oh, yeah?",2
SCULLY,"Mulder, I'm sorry that your confidential source didn't pan out.",10
MULDER,"Well, I guess you were right, Scully. Just another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek.",16
SCULLY,Good night.,2
MULDER,"Hey, Scully? I, uh, know it's not your normal life, but... Thanks for coming out there with me.",18
SCULLY,You're welcome.,2
