TERRANCE PRUIT,"I always said there's three kinds of people in the world: Them who make things happen, them who watch things happen and them who wonder what happened. I made things happen. The wrong things. I caused pain to anyone who came near me. ""Hellbound"".)",44
TERRANCE PRUIT,This tattoo used to be my badge of honor. I'm a different man since I've joined group. A better man. I never thought words like that would come out of my mouth. It's all because of the help and the love that I found in this room.,47
DR. HOLLAND,You're new here. Is it Ed?,6
ED KELSO,"Yeah, I'm new to this B.S.",6
DR. HOLLAND,Why do you think it's B.S.?,6
TERRANCE PRUIT,"I mean, listen, man, I turned my life around. A lot of us here have.",15
ED KELSO,Our kind of lives go one way. You can't change any more than you can undo the crimes you've done.,20
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Well, I feel sorry for you, man.",7
ED KELSO,"Don't feel sorry. You going to hell just like I am, brother.",12
DR. HOLLAND,"Why are you here, Ed?",5
ED KELSO,I drove Victor. He knows I'm right.,7
DR. HOLLAND,Victor's been doing good.,4
ED KELSO,"Oh, yeah... just look at him.",6
DR. HOLLAND,"Victor, you want to talk about it?",7
VICTOR DALE POTTS,I've just been having bad dreams. Really bad dreams.,9
DR. HOLLAND,What kind of dreams?,4
VICTOR DALE POTTS,Oh... seeing people skinned alive.,5
TERRANCE,"It's a hard road, Victor. It's a shock to the system: Changing the way we think taking charge of our lives. We're all afraid. And that fear preys on us night and day, brother. In our minds and in our dreams.",41
ED KELSO,"You ever get enough of that crap? ""A shock to the system"" crap? ""This fear preying on us night and day"" crap? Those boys in there are afraid Victor?",29
VICTOR,Sort of.,2
ED KELSO,"What do you mean, ""sort of""? Don't tell me that bull does you any good. And don't tell me you feel any better about yourself coming here... that it makes these nightmares go away.",34
VICTOR,No... it don't.,3
DOGGETT,Hey.,1
REYES,Hi. Thanks for coming. Sorry about the hour.,8
DOGGETT,The way you sounded seemed like something that couldn't wait.,10
REYES,"No. I need another set of eyes on it. I called Scully in, too.",14
DOGGETT,"A little late to be looking for a sitter. What's so pressing? ""Victor Dale Potts."" Ex-con, three-time loser, career criminal.",20
REYES,He was murdered five days ago. Scully's got the crime report.,11
DOGGETT,"I'm sorry, what am I missing?",6
REYES,It's the way he was killed.,6
SCULLY,Agent Doggett.,2
DOGGETT,Agent Scully.,2
REYES,I'd like him to see the body.,7
DOGGETT,Damn. I've seen a bunch of these when I was a cop. It's a favourite of some of the pan-Asian gangs.,21
REYES,The difference is Victor Potts had a premonition of his death.,11
DOGGETT,And?,1
SCULLY,That was my question.,4
REYES,"What I'm saying is, this man was skinned alive just hours after describing it in exact detail.",17
DOGGETT,Maybe he could describe it because maybe somebody threatened him.,10
REYES,"He said it came in a dream, or a vision according to the woman who last spoke to him.",19
DOGGETT,Who's that?,2
REYES,Dr. Lisa Holland. She's a therapist who runs an anger management group for ex-cons.,14
DOGGETT,"Lifelong criminal's bound to have some bad enemies. People capable of this very thing. I mean, unless there's something here that I'm just not seeing.",25
SCULLY,"Well, from what I could see from my visual exam the skin was removed with considerable skill by someone using a hunting-type knife. Arteries and veins were left intact so as to prolong the period that the victim would suffer.",40
DOGGETT,"Terrible way to die, for sure.",6
REYES,I know.,2
SCULLY,Is there anything else... Agent Reyes? Something special that brought this case to your attention as a possible X-File?,19
REYES,No. I just know I need to solve this and I'd appreciate your help.,14
DOGGETT,I'm Doggett. She's Reyes.,4
REYES,Detective Van Allen?,3
VAN ALLEN,That's right.,2
REYES,I appreciate your help on this.,6
VAN ALLEN,What help is that?,4
REYES,On this investigation.,3
VAN ALLEN,"There isn't a lot to investigate. I mean, Victor Potts wasn't exactly one of the FBI's ten most wanted.",19
DOGGETT,"I think she means your insight into the way he died, Detective.",12
VAN ALLEN,"Don't have any. But I'm sure you'd rather talk to somebody who actually gives a damn, right?",17
DOGGETT,"Hate to say it but, he probably sums up most people's feelings.",12
DR. HOLLAND,It's hard for the Victor Pottses of the world. Nobody cares much about them in life or in death.,19
REYES,Victor told the group a story about a dream he'd had.,11
DR. HOLLAND,These men are haunted by their pasts. That's why they're here.,11
REYES,But this dream came true.,5
DR. HOLLAND,Sometimes the past they want to escape won't let them. There Victor's case.,13
DOGGETT,You think he could have killed him?,7
DR. HOLLAND,"I try to help these men. Some have been violent, some still are. It's not my place to judge them.",20
DOGGETT,Dr. Holland there's justice to be served here. You can't forget that.,12
DR. HOLLAND,I'm sure Agent Reyes won't let me. Probably won't let anybody.,11
REYES,Thank you for your help.,5
DOGGETT,She contacted you with this case?,6
DR. HOLLAND,I think the police would have given up on who murdered Victor Potts if it wasn't for her.,18
VAN ALLEN,"You know something, Agent Reyes? You seem real familiar to me.",11
REYES,Excuse me?,2
VAN ALLEN,You ever visited Novi before?,5
REYES,"No, I never have.",4
ED KELSO,You eyeballing me? You got some kind of problem or something?,11
TERRANCE PRUIT,Problem? Your friend is dead.,5
ED KELSO,"Yeah, I guess the good news is I get to move up the ladder here now.",16
TERRANCE PRUIT,You know how it happened.,5
ED KELSO,"Now, why don't you just back off.",7
TERRANCE PRUIT,"FBI wants to talk to me now because of the way he died. Going to want to talk to you, too.",21
ED KELSO,I got nothing to tell nobody.,6
TERRANCE PRUIT,You were messing with his head.,6
ED KELSO,I'd watch what you go saying.,6
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Or what? You going to do me, too?",8
ED KELSO,I got a ride to catch.,6
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Yeah, that's right; walk away. But just like you said you can't run from what you are.",17
ED KELSO,"Yeah, and I'll see you in hell.",7
FBI CADET,"Here you go, Dr. Scully. Everything you ever wanted to know about skinning people but were afraid to ask. This is every case of removal of the human dermis I could find within the last dozen years.",37
SCULLY,Most of these are post-mortem skinnings.,6
FBI CADET,That's all I could find. And most of it's Asian gang-related like you mentioned.,14
SCULLY,Wait a minute. What's this?,5
FBI CADET,I'm sorry I probably shouldn't have included that one because it's pretty much ancient history.,15
SCULLY,It's just... there's a pattern. There's a pattern... the way the skin's been stripped off. A match?,17
FBI CADET,"No, but how could it be? Did you notice a date?",11
SCULLY,1960.,1
SCULLY,Excuse me. Dr. Mueller?,4
SCULLY,Dr. Bertram Mueller?,3
DR. MUELLER,Yes?,1
SCULLY,My name is Dana Scully. I'm with the FBI. I want to ask you some questions about a John Doe you did an autopsy on in 1960.,27
DR. MUELLER,You honestly expect me to recall some case from way back when? I'm 84 years old.,16
SCULLY,"Sir, this particular victim was skinned alive.",7
[CLOSED CAPTION SAYS,Will you button your blouse?],5
DR. MUELLER,"In all my days, I never saw anything as inhuman as this.",12
SCULLY,"Sir, I haven't located police records from the investigation. Was there ever a suspect who was charged or arrested in this case as far as you know?",27
DR. MUELLER,"No suspects, no investigation for that matter.",7
SCULLY,I don't understand.,3
DR. MUELLER,"The victim was a John Doe -- a nobody. Carl Hobart, the county sheriff, figured he was a drifter. Hobart said he didn't want to stir up the community.",28
SCULLY,And no one called him on that?,7
DR. MUELLER,"I tried... the sheriff had other things on his mind, I suppose.",12
SCULLY,Why do you say that?,5
DR. MUELLER,"Well, it wasn't long after that he put a bullet through his head. What are you thinking, doctor? This is some copycat murder 40-odd years later?",26
SCULLY,"If so, it's the most perfectly executed that I've ever seen. And why copy an obscure murder that nobody's ever even heard of?",23
DR. MUELLER,A string of murders.,4
SCULLY,I'm sorry?,2
DR. MUELLER,I thought you knew. John Doe was only the first.,10
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Is that you, Ed? Come see what I got for you.",11
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Tell you what. You best clear the hell out, whoever you are!",12
TERRANCE PRUIT,Hey!,1
TERRANCE PRUIT,"Oh, god! Oh, god, no! Let me go! Let me go!",11
REYES,Dr. Holland? Lisa?,3
REYES,Dr. Holland?,2
DOGGETT,Monica?,1
DOGGETT,What the hell are you dreaming about.,7
REYES,Nothing. It was a nightmare. How did you know to come in here?,13
DOGGETT,I was on the phone. I could hear you through the wall calling out.,14
REYES,Who were you on the phone to?,7
DOGGETT,"Dr. Lisa Holland. That anger-management group she runs, it's getting smaller.",11
VAN ALLEN,It's okay. Let 'em through.,5
REYES,What happened to the lights?,5
VAN ALLEN,Somebody cut 'em. Might want to watch your step. We got some blood on the floor. Not as much as you'd expect.,22
REYES,"Oh, my god!",3
DOGGETT,"Hey, you okay? Monica?",4
SCULLY,"Agent Reyes, I got a call from Agent Doggett. He said there's another victim. Monica, you okay?",17
REYES,I'm just catching my breath.,5
SCULLY,"Well, if you're up for it, I've got something to show you. Case files from crimes back in 1960.",19
REYES,What are they?,3
SCULLY,More skinned bodies... cut with the same precision as the body I examined.,13
DOGGETT,Can I see the light a second?,7
DOGGETT,"Holy God, he's still alive! Somebody get in here and get him down! We need a medic in here! Can you hear me? Do you understand? Who did this to you? Do you know who did this to you?",39
ROXANNE,"Are we going somewhere, baby?",5
ED KELSO,You're not. Get out.,4
ROXANNE,Eddie?,1
ED KELSO,What'd I just say?!,4
ROXANNE,But I'm not even dressed.,5
ED KELSO,What else is new? Get out!,6
ROXANNE,Why are you such a jerk?,6
DOGGETT,FBI! Stop right there!,4
DOGGETT,"What part of ""stop right there"" did you not understand?",10
DOGGETT,"So, what? He's just waiting for his lawyer? That's what he's doing?",12
DR. HOLLAND,"He's in a bad place. I've been there myself once or twice sitting right where he is now, not thinking you have a chance.",24
DOGGETT,Yeah? You ever murdered two men?,6
DR. HOLLAND,"He's four years out of prison holding down a job, showing up to work sober. Why do it? Kill a friend and a co-worker?",24
DOGGETT,"You're the one that said he was a hothead, right? Why run if you're not guilty? Bag packed to hit the road... packed with knives? him.",26
DOGGETT,What makes you say that?,5
REYES,Because I think this man here is running from something else. I want to talk to him.,17
REYES,"Hi. My name is Monica. I know what you're thinking, that I must be the good cop.",17
ED KELSO,No such thing.,3
REYES,"You didn't do it, did you? Your friend, Victor, he said he had bad dreams seeing things. I think you're seeing them now.",23
ED KELSO,How would you know?,4
REYES,"Maybe I see them, too.",5
DOGGETT,Can I talk to you for a second?,8
DOGGETT,You want to explain to me what you're doing in there Agent Reyes?,13
REYES,I'm trying to make a connection.,6
DOGGETT,"Hell of a way to do it. I can see this guy's defence already. ""Your honor, I was having bad dreams... seeing things. Ask Agent Reyes, she's seeing 'em, too."" Something you're not telling me?",35
VAN ALLEN,You two about finished?,4
DOGGETT,With what?,2
VAN ALLEN,The suspect. He's not our man.,6
DOGGETT,What are you talking about?,5
VAN ALLEN,Girlfriend vouched for him. Said they were getting hammered down,10
DOGGETT,"I know where you live, partner.",6
DR. HOLLAND,You're always welcome at group.,5
REYES,Agent Reyes.,2
SCULLY,"I need you to come to Quantico right away, Monica.",10
[CLOSED CAPTION READS,"SCULLY: What's your connection to this case, Monica?]",8
REYES,Why?,1
SCULLY,I have something to show you.,6
REYES,Agent Scully?,2
SCULLY,Agent Reyes.,2
REYES,What are these?,3
SCULLY,"I showed you files of men killed in 1960 skinned alive like the current victims. Well, I had two of those bodies exhumed looking for crossover forensic details.",28
REYES,Are there any?,3
SCULLY,"Yes, there are cuts in the bone... on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles that matched the cutting pattern that I found on Victor Potts... using the exact same knife which left a signature pattern of grooves.",38
REYES,"Same knife, same killer that's what you're saying, right?",9
SCULLY,"Well, it's even weirder than that. I ran bios and backgrounds from the victims from 1960.",16
REYES,They're both ex-convicts like the current victims?,7
SCULLY,Mm-hmm. But look at the date that they died.,9
REYES,"March eighth, 1960. June 21st, 1960. brown.) R-7436 a; VA c54663 n; white; June 21, 1960; Craigsville, VA; 41; 175; med.)",21
SCULLY,"Birth dates of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit. Potts and Pruit were born on the same dates that the previous victims died. You knew that we'd find something like this didn't you, Agent Reyes? How?",35
DOGGETT,John Doggett.,2
REYES,Where are you?,3
DOGGETT,Sitting outside the suspect's house wondering where the surveillance is I ordered.,12
REYES,I need a birthdate on him.,6
DOGGETT,Who?,1
REYES,"The suspect, Ed Kelso. It's important. He may be in danger.",11
DOGGETT,He may be gone. I'll call you.,7
DOGGETT,"Yeah, this is John Doggett. I need to speak with Detective Van Allen. I'll hang on. Just get him.",19
DOGGETT,"No, I'm still holding.",4
DOGGETT,I said this house was supposed to be under a 24-hour watch.,12
VAN ALLEN,"Patrolman says he wasn't gone more than five minutes. to do that to somebody, detective? Only know you said watch him so he don't run.",25
REYES,Agent Doggett...,2
REYES,I have something to tell you.,6
DOGGETT,"This thing with the birthdays is weird, no doubt about it. Looks to me like we're dealing with a real sick puppy here.",23
REYES,I don't think so.,4
DOGGETT,Choosing your victims because of their damn birth dates it's the very definition of a serial killer. I think we should get the boys from behavioural science out on this.,30
REYES,No. That's not what's happening here.,6
DOGGETT,It's the only thing that makes sense.,7
REYES,To you.,2
DOGGETT,"Okay, what do you think it is?",7
REYES,He knew he was going to die. He had a premonition of his death. Just like the first victim did.,20
DOGGETT,So how do you figure that?,6
REYES,I'm involved in this some way. I have some kind of memory of it. It's all happened before and now it's happening again.,23
DOGGETT,You mean that it's a copycat and you have some kind of recall.,13
REYES,These men were born to die this way. The same way they died before.,14
DOGGETT,The same way they died before?,6
REYES,Not the men... but their souls. Their souls are murdered over and over again from one lifetime to the next. By someone who won't let them rest.,27
DOGGETT,So how's this happening... their souls coming back? Reincarnation?,9
REYES,It doesn't strike you that these men were all born on the dates of the previous victims' deaths?,18
DOGGETT,"Yeah, it strikes me. It strikes me that the killer is clever.",12
REYES,A rag is stuffed in his mouth. A dirty rag. Black with soot.,13
REYES,Coal dust... from a coal mine.,6
DOGGETT,How the hell did you know that?,7
REYES,I don't know.,3
DOGGETT,So what are we looking for?,6
REYES,I don't know exactly. But if the old files are correct there's going to be a fourth victim.,18
DOGGETT,It looks like housekeeping hasn't been here in awhile.,9
REYES,You or me?,3
REYES,I'll check out the mine.,5

DOGGETT,Agent Reyes. Are you hurt? Talk to me.,8
REYES,He was here.,3
DOGGETT,Who?,1
REYES,Van Allen. He's who's killing these men.,7
DOGGETT,Van Allen?,2
REYES,He was skinned himself. Back in 1868 by four men in a mining dispute. His killers were never punished. Now he's born to keep avenging that injustice. Again and again.,30
DOGGETT,Van Allen's the cop here.,5
REYES,"That's why these cases never get solved. Every time, four murders. Every time, four bodies. Then he takes his own life so he can just start it up all over again. There's still a fourth victim, and I think I know who it is. VICTOR DALE POTTS, TERRANCE PRUIT, ED KELSO, and DR. LISA HOLLAND .]",55
DR. HOLLAND,Lisa Holland.,2
REYES,"Dr. Holland, it's Monica Reyes. You've seen the visions, haven't you? Just like the others in your group. Visions of people skinned alive. It's true, isn't it?",27
DR. HOLLAND,How did you know?,4
REYES,Where are you now?,4
DR. HOLLAND,I'm just finishing a session.,5
REYES,Is there anybody with you?,5
DR. HOLLAND,"No, they've all left. Why? What's this about?",8
REYES,Get out of there. You're in danger. It's Detective Van Allen. He's coming after you.,15
REYES,Dr. Holland? Dr. Holland.,4
VAN ALLEN,Time's come! You're the last.,5
REYES,Get the paramedics out here.,5

REYES,"You still won't believe it, will you? My connection to this man.",12
DOGGETT,However you did it... however you knew what you know what matters here is you saved a woman's life.,19
SCULLY,He's trying. We all are. It's just a long way to go from this...... to this...,16
REYES,"Do you believe in second chances, Dana? A chance to correct the mistakes we make in our lives?",18
SCULLY,You mean in a future life?,6
REYES,"That's what these people were trying to do. All the victims... trying to atone for their sins from what happened in that photo. Only this man wouldn't let them. mining camp. c. 1868.... "" and ""... killed in a claim dispute by the men standing over his corpse. No persons... "" ]",48
SCULLY,And Lisa Holland? What about her?,6
REYES,She was one of them. One of the men you see standing there.,13
SCULLY,And you?,2
REYES,"Whoever I was, I failed. In 1868. In 1909. In 1960, I failed. I was always there, but I couldn't stop the killings. And he knew that. Just like he knows I'm here right now. He feels me -- the way I felt him when I saw that picture of the first victim. And somehow he knows my deepest fear that I'll fail.",62
SCULLY,"Well, maybe in this life you succeed.",7
REYES,Maybe.,1
