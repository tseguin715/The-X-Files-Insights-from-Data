KATH,"What's happening, Duffy? Something's happening.",5
DR. LEV,"Nurse, get the team in here for an emergency C-section.",10

DOGGETT,Agent Scully...,2
SCULLY,Hi.,1
DUFFY HASKELL,Hi.,1
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, Agent Doggett, I didn't realize that you had an appointment.",12
DOGGETT,This is Duffy Haskell. He says he knows you or you know him.,13
SCULLY,I'm sorry. I don't remember.,5
DUFFY HASKELL,I contacted you about my wife About eight years ago because she was an alien abductee.,16
SCULLY,"That was before my time here. But, uh, is there something I can help you with?",16
DUFFY HASKELL,She's dead. My wife is dead now. They killed her. Kath-- my wife.,13
DOGGETT,I checked the files. Mr. Haskell wrote several letters to Agent Mulder describing his wife's abduction experiences.,17
DUFFY HASKELL,My wife gave birth to an alien.,7
SCULLY,I-I thought you said that your wife was murdered.,9
DUFFY HASKELL,That's the reason they did it.,6
SCULLY,"Ooo-kay, Mr. Haskell. Why don't you, uh, start from the beginning.",11
DUFFY HASKELL,"Kath was a multiple abductee. The aliens did these procedures on her. Tests and whatnot. One procedure would give her cancer while another one would cure her. Stuff like that. For years, you see. And then, this year, they came right into our bedroom and implanted an alien embryo in Kath.",51
SCULLY,"I don't suppose that you have any, uh, medical proof of this.",12
DUFFY HASKELL,I have an ultrasound here. Anyone with a trained eye can see that is a bizarre pregnancy. Especially for a woman who was never supposed to be able to conceive. I doubt you'd ever get the doctors to cop to any of that.,43
SCULLY,What doctors?,2
DUFFY HASKELL,We've been through three sets. They're all in on it. They're all in cahoots.,14
SCULLY,So you're... saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife?,12
DUFFY HASKELL,And stole the alien baby. That ultrasound is proof.,9
SCULLY,"Do you, uh... have all the information and numbers and a way that we can reach Mr. Haskell?",18
SCULLY,"Uh, we'll be in touch.",5
DUFFY HASKELL,Thank you. Thank you very much.,6
SCULLY,"Thank you, Agent Doggett. I'm sure the rest of my afternoon can't possibly be so amusing.",16
DOGGETT,"I thought you'd find it interesting, actually.",7
SCULLY,Interesting? As in preposterous and outrageous?,6
DOGGETT,"Well, unless I'm mistaken you already knew that man's story. The abduction the tests, a bout with cancer then a remission.",21
SCULLY,What exactly are you getting at?,6
DOGGETT,"That's your story, Agent Scully. I'd say right down to a tee.",12
DOGGETT,"I mean, except for the pregnancy. It's all right there in the X-Files.",13
SCULLY,"Well, I appreciate your thoroughness, Agent Doggett, and your familiarity with the X-Files cases in those cabinets, but my personal files are my personal files. Okay?",26
DOGGETT,"Sure, of course.",3
MULDER,There you are. I've been looking all over for you.,10
SCULLY,"Hi. Um, I'm sorry. I had a doctor's appointment and, um, I don't know, I guess time just got away from me.",22
MULDER,Is anything the matter?,4
SCULLY,"Nothing. No, I just, uh... I went for a walk.",10
MULDER,Mmm. Then what's wrong?,4
SCULLY,"I'm... I'm sorry I haven't told you. I don't know why I haven't. I mean, you were always there for me during my illness but, um...",26
MULDER,Don't make me guess.,4
SCULLY,I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me. And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children.,27
MULDER,"Scully, there's, um, there's something I haven't told you either and I hope you, uh, forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you.",27
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you were left barren. Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab.,28
SCULLY,What?,1
SCULLY,You found them?,3
MULDER,I-I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were okay.,15
SCULLY,I don't believe this.,4
MULDER,"Scully, you were deathly ill, and I... I couldn't bear to give you another piece of bad news.",18
SCULLY,Is that what it was? It was bad news?,9
MULDER,The doctor said that the ova weren't viable.,8
SCULLY,I want a second opinion.,5
DOGGETT,Agent Scully? What are you doing?,6
SCULLY,"Um, I don't know. I guess I just forgot to push the button.",13
DOGGETT,I wasn't exactly clear on what you wanted to do about this guy Haskell. About his wife's story.,18
SCULLY,There's nothing to do.,4
SCULLY,Hello. Is anybody here?,4
WOMAN'S VOICE,This is my baby. I have to know...,8
DR. LEV,"Ms. Hendershot, try to stay calm. I'm doing all I can....",11
MRS. HENDERSHOT,"No, listen to me. You don't know, you don't know.",10
DR. LEV,Just try and stay calm. There are no similarities between your baby and the others.,15
MRS. HENDERSHOT,How can you say that? You don't know that.,9
DR. LEV,Because I know both cases. Try to keep her as calm as possible. I'm going to get another doctor.,19
MRS. HENDERSHOT,"No, no, I'm not staying here. I'm not staying here.",10
DR. LEV,Who are you? What are you doing here?,8
SCULLY,"I'm, um, I'm here with my friend.",7
DR. LEV,You're here with Ms. Hendershot?,5
SCULLY,Yes. I'm worried about her.,5
DR. LEV,"Ms. Hendershot is fine. But you'll have to wait up front, please. You can't be back here.",17
SEFVICE,Parenti Medical Group.,3
SCULLY,"Yes, I want to speak to Dr. Parenti, please.",9
SEFVICE,This is his service. I can reach him if it's an emergency.,12
SCULLY,"Yes, it is. It's Dana Scully.",6
DR. PARENTI,Dana? What's wrong?,3
SCULLY,I'm afraid.,2
DR. PARENTI,Tell me what it is.,5
SCULLY,I want you to look at something for me. Right away. It's an ultrasound.,14
DR. PARENTI,"Well, I'm not in my office right now. Can you send it over there? I'll look at it as soon as possible.",22
SCULLY,I want you to compare it to mine.,8
DR. PARENTI,Dana... are you going to be okay?,7
SCULLY,"Yes. Fine, I'm... I'm okay.",5
DR. PARENTI,"All right, I'll get back to you, Dana.",8
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
DR. PARENTI,Ms. Scully? Got a good report for you. I've looked at the ova you've given me and consulted with some of my colleagues. We all feel that with the proper approach we might be successful. Got a good chance to get you pregnant.,43
SCULLY,Oh... It's too good to be true.,7
DR. PARENTI,I don't want to lay odds but it's not out of the realm of possibility if we start soon.,19
SCULLY,We can start right away?,5
DR. PARENTI,"Well, you need a father, of course. I can get you genetic counseling on finding an anonymous donor if that's what you want... unless you already have someone in mind.",30
SCULLY,"Yeah... I, uh... I just have to figure out how to ask him.",13
DR. PARENTI,Dana? You want to come on back?,7
SCULLY,What did you find?,4
DR. PARENTI,I looked at this ultrasound you sent me and... I don't know what I'm supposed to be seeing but it looks fine to me. As does your own ultrasound.,29
SCULLY,You didn't see anything strange?,5
DR. PARENTI,Why do you ask that?,5
SCULLY,I just want to be sure. I've had... complications.,9
DR. PARENTI,It's normal to be worried.,5
SCULLY,Okay. Thank you.,3
DR. PARENTI,You bet.,2
DR. PARENTI,"Your only concern right now is when you're going to tell the FBI. Can't keep it a secret forever, Dana. You're going to start showing soon.",26
SCULLY,Right.,1
DOGGETT,"Okay, got it. Thanks.",4
DOGGETT,"Agent Scully, I just got a call from a Dr. Parenti's office. About an ultrasound you left there this morning.",20
SCULLY,Dr. Parenti is my doctor.,5
DOGGETT,"Come on, Agent Scully.",4
SCULLY,You don't believe me?,4
DOGGETT,That ultrasound is the one Duffy Haskell left here yesterday. Dr. Parenti is one of the doctors he consulted with during the course of that pregnancy.,26
SCULLY,"Excuse me, Agent Doggett, but are you investigating me?",9
DOGGETT,"No, I was doing a background check on Mr. And Mrs. Haskell before I dropped the case, like you asked me to do.",23
SCULLY,"No, I didn't ask you to drop the case. I said there was nothing to do.",16
DOGGETT,"Well, if there's nothing to do, then why are you investigating?",11
SCULLY,You are jumping to conclusions.,5
DOGGETT,"No, I'm just trying to do my job, only it gets hard to do if the person you're working with is keeping secrets and telling lies.",26
SCULLY,"I am not investigating these people, Agent Doggett. Parenti is my doctor. Is that so strange? Is there something about him I don't know?",24
DOGGETT,No. But Duffy Haskell is a piece of work. I'll tell you that much.,14
DUFFY HASKELL,What am I being accused of? What did you call me in here for? You were going to help me.,20
SKINNER,"As president of the Ohio Mutual UFO Network you sent Agent Mulder a series of very threatening letters which he passed on to me, Mr. Haskell. Something of a habit with you, sir. Writing letters... threatening letters. Isn't it?",39
DUFFY HASKELL,No one will believe me.,5
DOGGETT,You wrote a letter to a Dr. Lev saying you would kill him if he hurt your wife.,18
DUFFY HASKELL,Dr. Lev killed my wife. He stole the alien baby out of her womb.,14
DOGGETT,"Well, I can't find any documentation that the two of you were even married, Mr. Haskell. Let alone any history or evidence of foul play. Dr. Lev is a serious physician, a leader in the field of birth defects. His peers hold him in the highest regard. Why would he ever kill your wife?",54
DUFFY HASKELL,That's why I came to you.,6
SKINNER,"Mr. Haskell, allegations aside, it's a crime to threaten anyone.",10
DUFFY HASKELL,"You believe me, don't you?",5
SKINNER,"Mr. Haskell, we're sorry for your loss, but if you persist in these threats and in disseminating these stories we're going to have to enter your name in the federal system as a dangerous individual.",35
DUFFY HASKELL,I'm alone now because of them. They took everything from me.,11
DUFFY HASKELL,And there are other women out there just like Kath.,10
DR. LEV,"Zeus Genetics, Dr. Lev speaking.",5
DUFFY HASKELL,They called me back here to the FBI to poke holes in my story.,14
DR. LEV,As we knew they would.,5
DUFFY HASKELL,We still risk losing Hendershot.,5
DR. LEV,Then it's time to let her go.,7
SCULLY,Hi.,1
MULDER,Hi.,1
SCULLY,Come on in.,3
MULDER,Thanks.,1
SCULLY,Can I take your coat?,5
MULDER,"No, I can't stay. I gotta get back to the office for a while.",14
SCULLY,Obviously you've had some time to think about my request.,10
MULDER,"Um, it's... it's not something that I get asked to do every day. Um, but I am absolutely flattered.",19
MULDER,"No, honestly.",2
SCULLY,"Okay, if... if you're trying to politely say ""no,"" it's okay. I, I understand.",14
MULDER,"See what's weird is... this sounds, and this sounds really weird, I know, but I, I just wouldn't want this to come between us.",24
SCULLY,"Yeah. I know... I, I understand. I do.",8
MULDER,"Well... the answer is ""yes.""",5
SCULLY,"Um... Well, I'll call Dr. Parenti and...",7
SCULLY,"I assume that he'll want to meet you and go through the, uh, the donor procedure.",16
MULDER,"At that part, I'm a pro.",6
MRS. HENDERSHOT,My name is Mary Hendershot. My baby's in danger. So is yours.,12
DOGGETT,"Can I have some coffee-- black, please?",7
WAITRESS,Sure.,1
SKINNER,Thanks for getting down here.,5
DOGGETT,Yeah.,1
DOGGETT,You going somewhere?,3
SCULLY,Yes.,1
DOGGETT,Am I missing something here?,5
[CARRIK,"Are you ever, buddy.]",4
SKINNER,Agent Doggett as Assistant Director in charge of your assignment Agent Scully has come to me and asked to take a leave of absence.,24
DOGGETT,"Hey, great. Can I ask why?",6
SCULLY,No.,1
DOGGETT,So I'm the X-Files now? Just me?,7
SKINNER,Agent Scully isn't quitting the FBI. She's just going away.,10
DOGGETT,Thanks for getting me out of bed to give me the news.,12
DOGGETT,Drop me a line if you get a chance.,9
SKINNER,"You gotta tell him, Scully.",5
SCULLY,I can't.,2
SCULLY,Agent Doggett?,2
SCULLY,I want you to understand.,5
DOGGETT,"What is it you want me to understand, Agent Scully? The secrets or the lies?",15
SCULLY,I told you... I'm not doing anything behind your back.,10
DOGGETT,"You're supposed to watch my back, Agent Scully.",8
SCULLY,If I was putting you at risk in any way you can be sure that I wouldn't let you down. I hope you know that. I only know what you tell me.,32
SCULLY,I gotta go.,3
DOGGETT,Who's that... In Agent Scully's car?,6
SKINNER,"That I don't know, Agent Doggett.",6
DR. MIRYUM,You're Scully? Agent Scully?,4
SCULLY,"Yes, Dana Scully. This is Ms. Hendershot. Mary Hendershot.",9
MULDER,I'm Dr. Miryum. These are the best team of obstetricians one could hope to assemble. Now you tell them what you told me.,23
SCULLY,"Ms. Hendershot believes that she is carrying a baby that is not her own. That, by whatever means, at 40 weeks she is about to give birth to something inhuman.",30
FIRST ASSOCIATE,Does she have medical records?,5
MRS. HENDERSHOT,I can't trust my doctors.,5
SCULLY,"She believes, and with possible good reason, that her life may be in danger. That women just like her have been murdered in childbirth.",24
SECOND ASSOCIATE,Why? Because it sounds insane.,5
MRS. HENDERSHOT,These doctors killed a friend of mine because she was on to them. Because she saw too much.,18
SCULLY,You should know that I'm not just here as an FBI agent.,12
DR. MIRYUM,Agent Scully is an MD.,5
FIRST ASSOCIATE,So what is it she's carrying?,6
SCULLY,That's why we've come to you.,6
DR. MIRYUM,All right. Let's get Ms. Hendershot prepped and ready.,9
MRS. HENDERSHOT,For what?,2
DR. MIRYUM,"You're going to have this baby, Ms. Hendershot. Our big concern right now is you have it safely. Whatever it is in you we'll know in a few hours from now if we induce labour immediately.",36
DR. MIRYUM,How did this woman find you?,6
SCULLY,A man named Haskell led her to me. His pregnant wife is now dead.,14
SCULLY,Dr. Miryum... she's not the only woman whose life is in danger.,12
DOGGETT,Agent Farah.,2
AGENT JOE FARAH,"I didn't see you in here, John. What are you doing in the dark?",14
DOGGETT,"I'm in the dark pretty much most of my time on the X-Files, Joe.",14
AGENT JOE FARAH,Got a little something you may want to shine a light on.,12
AGENT JOE FARAH,"You had me run this guy Duffy Haskell's prints, right?",10
DOGGETT,"I hate to say that case is closed now, Joe.",10
AGENT JOE FARAH,"From what I found, it's been closed since 1970. When David Haskell, same prints, was buried in a Virginia cemetery-- USMC honor guard ceremony.",24
DOGGETT,You're kidding.,2
AGENT JOE FARAH,I kid you not. Looks like you got yourself a real spook.,12
DOGGETT,Or a snake in the grass.,6
MRS. HENDERSHOT,How long will this take?,5
SCULLY,Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours.,7
MRS. HENDERSHOT,All my life I wanted children. But I'm afraid of what's growing in me. That it even happened.,18
SCULLY,You mean getting pregnant?,4
MRS. HENDERSHOT,"I had a boyfriend. When I looked at the dates, there was no way. Now I'm sure it was an abduction. I'm sure of what's inside of me.",28
DR. MIRYUM,Agent Scully... we're all set for you.,7
DR. MIRYUM,You ready for this?,4
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
DR. MIRYUM,"At your stage, the foetus is still only about eight centimetres, but we should still be able to get a pretty clear picture of its development.",26
DR. MIRYUM,There it is. You see it?,6
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
DR. MIRYUM,"I see two legs, two arms and hands. I see what would appear to be a healthy baby at 14 weeks.",21
SCULLY,Are you sure?,3
DR. MIRYUM,"The picture doesn't lie, Agent Scully. Hard to tell, but... would you like to know the sex?",17
SCULLY,I just want to be certain that it's okay.,9
DR. MIRYUM,"We could do an amnio. It's a little early, but we could do it if that's what you want.",19
DOGGETT,Knowle... can I talk to you?,6
KNOWLE ROHRER,"John, what are you doing here?",6
DOGGETT,Your assistant said you were going to get right back to me about this David Haskell fingerprint.,17
KNOWLE ROHRER,"I've got a day job, John. The government gets suspicious if I work at too fast a pace.",18
DOGGETT,"I can't wait, Knowle. Is it the same guy, or not?",11
KNOWLE ROHRER,"How about we take a walk? How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?",14
DOGGETT,"The man was in my office, Knowle. Military records show he died in 1970. What the hell's the story?",19
KNOWLE ROHRER,Possible He's intelligence.,3
DOGGETT,Doing what? Working for who?,5
KNOWLE ROHRER,What did he say he wanted?,6
DOGGETT,He wanted us to investigate the murder of his wife. He claims she was an alien abductee.,17
DOGGETT,Look... I don't buy this crap but if the guy's CIA he wasn't just in my office killing time.,19
KNOWLE ROHRER,Why go to the trouble at all?,7
DOGGETT,All I can think is that there must be documentation in our files of a conspiracy to hide the truth.,20
KNOWLE ROHRER,"About what, extraterrestrials?",3
DOGGETT,"Look, it's not my work. It's the woman I work with-- an Agent Scully.",14
KNOWLE ROHRER,"John, there's no conspiracy. You and I go back a long time. You know I'll do anything I can for you. Just give me a little more time to find out who this Haskell guy is, okay? By the end of the day.",43
DR. MIRYUM,"I know I don't have to tell you, but you need to take it easy now after the procedure. The baby's at risk if the membrane were to rupture, all right?",31
SCULLY,Yeah. I just want to know. I'm anxious about the results.,11
DR. MIRYUM,"Well, we're hoping Mrs. Hendershot will deliver in the next few hours. You're our next priority.",16
SCULLY,Ms. Hendershot... you have to get up.,7
SCULLY,I have to get you out of here.,8
SKINNER,"Agent Doggett, what is it?",5
DOGGETT,Scully-- do you know where she is? How to alert her right away?,13
SKINNER,To what?,2
DOGGETT,"I think she's been misled. We all have by this man,Haskell.",11
SKINNER,You think or you know?,5
DOGGETT,I can't get a straight answer on that which leads me to believe that this was a setup from the start-- that this guy Haskell came to us with his story to get Agent Scully to go wherever she's gone.,40
SKINNER,"I can tell you that she's in a safe place, Agent Doggett. A hospital.",14
DOGGETT,What hospital?,2
DOGGETT,"Look, this involves doctors. Doctors who may have killed pregnant women. Now, a hospital could be the worst place in the world for her. Tell me where Scully is.",29
SKINNER,Walden-Freedman Army Hospital.,3
DOGGETT,Get on the phone to security there. Tell them everything I told you.,13
SCURITY OFFICER,Security...,1
SCULLY,Can you do this?,4
DR. MIRYUM,We've got two patients missing .,5
KNOWLE ROHRER,I need you to follow us. I'm a friend of John Doggett's.,12
SCULLY,Who are you?,3
KNOWLE ROHRER,That's not important. Get in the car. We're going to get you out. Go.,14
SCULLY,This woman could give birth at any minute. I hope you realize that.,13
KNOWLE ROHRER,You're in good hands. These men are experienced field medics.,10
SCULLY,Where are you taking us?,5
KNOWLE ROHRER,We're going to get you to the closest hospital where we can make sure this kid is born safe.,19
SCULLY,Oh.,1
KNOWLE ROHRER,Are you going to make it?,6
SCULLY,"Yeah, I just... just had a procedure. I shouldn't even be on my feet.",14
KNOWLE ROHRER,"Who the hell is this? Get off this road, now.",10
MRS. HENDERSHOT,Oh!!,1
SCULLY,Mrs. Hendershot?,2
MRS. HENDERSHOT,I think it's coming.,4
SCULLY,We have to stop this car.,6
KNOWLE ROHRER,Not until it's safe.,4
SCULLY,If you don't stop this car you could be endangering her life.,12
KNOWLE ROHRER,Stop the car.,3
MEDIC,"Just relax, ma'am.",3
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
KNOWLES ROHRER,"Making sure you don't hurt yourself, Agent Scully.",8
SCULLY,I'm fine. Let go of me.,6
KNOWLES ROHRER,It's for your own good.,5
SCULLY,Who are you?,3
SCULLY,Ms. Hendershot...,2
SCULLY,Mary!,1
KNOWLES ROHRER,Agent Scully... we're going to have to sedate you.,9
SCULLY,No!,1
KNOWLES ROHRER,Get in the car.,4
SCULLY,Hey!,1
SCULLY,Agent Doggett?,2
DOGGETT,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,What are you doing here? What am I doing back in this place?,13
DOGGETT,"Lie down, Agent Scully. You're not taking any more chances.",10
SCULLY,What happened to me?,4
DOGGETT,You're okay. You're fine. And your baby's fine.,8
DOGGETT,"But you're very, very lucky.",5
SCULLY,What about Ms. Hendershot?,4
DOGGETT,"She's resting fine, too.",4
SCULLY,What about her baby?,4
DOGGETT,"Six pounds, eight ounces. A boy.",6
SCULLY,"Oh, my god. They switched it. Agent Doggett, they switched it on her.",13
DOGGETT,"It's over, Agent Scully.",4
SCULLY,"No, it's not. We can prove this.",7
DOGGETT,"We can't prove anything. They say you overreacted to everything. They say you overreacted to fears you had about Ms. Hendershot's pregnancy, to the fears you had about your own.",30
SCULLY,They showed me a tape of another woman's womb.,9
DOGGETT,They say it's your baby just taped onto an old cassette.,11
SCULLY,"Well, then who were those men?",6
DOGGETT,"They acted off information that came from me. They say they saved your life. How can I question that, standing here?",21
SCULLY,"It was all planned. You know that. From the moment that man walked into our office. we were used to get at Ms. Hendershot's baby. And now we are being used to cover it up. Oh, my God.",38
DOGGETT,At least you're okay. Why didn't you tell me?,9
SCULLY,I was afraid. Afraid that they'd use it against me to take me off the X-Files so that I couldn't find Mulder.,22
DOGGETT,I told you I'd help you. I said we'd find him.,11
MULDER,Scully? I must have dozed off. I was waiting for you to get back.,14
MULDER,"It didn't take, did it?",5
SCULLY,I guess it was too much to hope for.,9
SCULLY,It was my last chance.,5
MULDER,Never give up on a miracle. the hospital holding her pillow. Her hand drifts down to her belly.),18
