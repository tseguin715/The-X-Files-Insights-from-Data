TEACHER,"All right everyone, we've run out of time.",8
TEACHER,That's right. We're finished. You'll have more time next week.,10
MALE STUDENT,"Hey, man!",2
MOSTOW,Excuse me. OUTSIDE ALLEY,4
MOSTOW'S APARTMENT 6,30 AM,2
FBI AGENT,FBI!!,1
FBI AGENT,Don't move!,2
FBI AGENT,John Mostow... We have a warrant for your arrest. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right...,22
FBI AGENT,Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.,13
FBI AGENT,Do you understand these rights as they've been explained to you?,11
FBI AGENT,Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent?,11
NEMHAUSER,OH GOD! He bit me! The son of a bitch bit me like a dog!,15
FBI AGENT,"Nemhauser, you okay?",3
NEMHAUSER,Yeah.,1
PATTERSON,My God...,2
MULDER,"He's an unemployed painter, divorced, no children. He came to the US from Uzbekistan during Perestroika. He failed to mention on his INS application that he spent the better part of his twenties in an insane asylum.",37
SCULLY,He was arrested last week for the murders of at least seven men.,13
MULDER,You thought all they produced were great hockey players. The crimes took place over a three year period. All the victims were male. Aged 17 to 25.,27
SCULLY,Was there a signature or a defining MO?,8
MULDER,"Well, according to the ME there was no evidence of any sexual assault. Death was caused by massive blood loss due to facial mutilation. We also reported that the wound pattern on all the victims was identical. It's all there on page three.",43
SCULLY,Both eyes punctured... signature gashes from the corners of the mouth to the ears.,14
SCULLY,The level of violence and overkill here would suggest the work of a very angry individual.,16
MULDER,"Or individuals, if you count the spirit Mostow says possessed him during the murders.",14
SCULLY,"Well, possession is a common claim by criminals who have dissociative disorders. It's how they... distance themselves from their actions.",20
MULDER,That was the operational opinion until last night...,8
MULDER,When a 19 year old male was found dead six miles from here with an identical set of facial wounds.,20
SCULLY,A copy cat?,3
MULDER,"Well, according to Assistant Director Skinner, who asked us to look into this case, the details of the mutilations were never released. Only members of the crime team would have that information. And Mostow's been in custody for five days.",40
MOSTOW,Please! The light hurts my eyes.,6
MOSTOW,Leave me alone...,3
SCULLY,"You have a nice soft bunk, sir. Why aren't you using it?",12
MULDER,Cuz he's been working.,4
MULDER,"Haven't you, John? What is it? What is this thing?",10
MOSTOW,It killed those men.,4
MULDER,Does it have a name? Does it have a name to go with that face?,15
MOSTOW,All men know its name.,5
MULDER,What do you call it? Satan? The devil?,8
SCULLY,Or maybe it's just the name of your accomplice.,9
MOSTOW,I had no accomplice.,4
SCULLY,You killed all those young men yourself?,7
MOSTOW,It killed them. How many times do I have to tell you?,12
SCULLY,"Well, its fingerprints weren't on the murder weapon, yours were. And it won't be tried for seven murders under the death penalty.",22
MOSTOW,"That is why it laughs at fools like you... And you... fools who would pretend evil can be brought to heel like a brindle bitch or be held by your pathetic gulags. While with a snap of its finger, it makes men lick the greasy floor of hell... Just to see its reflection.",53
SCULLY,"Is that was it did last night, John? Snapped its fingers and let another young man die?",17
MOSTOW,It killed again? Yesterday? It found somebody... just like it found me.,12
PATTERSON,Agent Mulder... Can I see you two outside? HALLWAY,9
PATTERSON,"So what is it, Mulder? Little green men, evil spirits, hounds of hell?",13
MULDER,"Scully, this is Bill Patterson. He runs the investigative support unit out of Quantico.",14
SCULLY,"Yes, I know. Behavioral Science... You wrote the book. It's a honor, sir.",13
PATTERSON,"Is that what you think, too? That the suspect is possessed by some dark spirit?",15
SCULLY,"No, not at all, sir.",5
PATTERSON,Funny company you keep then.,5
MULDER,"That's what always amazed me about you, Bill. You never fit your own profile. No one would ever guess how really mean-spirited you are.",24
PATTERSON,The arrest of John Mostow...,5
PATTERSON,Resulted in three years of hard work by my unit. Three years... You can imagine we were awful upset by this latest murder. And by the suspect floating this possession theory.,31
MULDER,You think he's got an accomplice then. Even though your own profile of Mostow states that he's most certainly working alone.,21
PATTERSON,"My profile led to his arrest. No, he acted alone. And that murder last night was done by a second killer, and he acted alone too.",26
MULDER,What about these drawings of Mostow's? The gargoyles?,8
PATTERSON,You know why he draws those? Did you ask him?,10
MULDER,I didn't get a chance to...,6
PATTERSON,He says he draws them to keep this demon of his away.,12
MULDER,"Well, that would make sense. Historically, that's what gargoyles have been used for. To ward off evil spirits. Like on the eaves of buildings.",24
PATTERSON,"Come on, Mulder. I don't need a history lesson. And I don't need anyone indulging this guy's story.",18
MULDER,I was asked to look into this case. If you've got a problem with that I suggest you take it up with AD Skinner.,24
SCULLY,You're not going to tell me when your love affair with Patterson ended?,13
MULDER,Patterson never liked me.,4
SCULLY,I thought you were considered his fair-haired boy when you joined the bureau.,13
MULDER,Not by Patterson.,3
SCULLY,Why not?,2
MULDER,Didn't want to get my knees dirty.,7
MULDER,Couldn't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student.,11
SCULLY,You mean you couldn't worship him.,6
MULDER,Something like that. Yeah.,4
SCULLY,"Well, from what I hear, there are a lot of men who did. A lot of men joined the FBI because they wanted to be him.",26
MULDER,"Yeah, Patterson had this thing about wanting to track a killer, to know an artist, you have to look at his art. It really meant, if you want to catch a monster, you have to become one yourself.",38
SCULLY,"By the looks of this, I'd say that served him pretty well.",12
MULDER,This guy is definitely some kind of monster.,8
MULDER,It's just a cat...,4
SCULLY,I thought it was one of those pictures coming to life.,11
SCULLY,One of our guys must have locked it in here.,10
MULDER,No. He obviously has his own key to the place.,10
MULDER,There's air coming through here. There could be something on the other side of the wall.,16
SCULLY,It's a door.,3
SCULLY,Why don't you wait until we can get some more light in here?,13
MULDER,I've got some light.,4
SCULLY,See anything?,2
MULDER,"More gargoyles, Scully. Lots of them. Sculpted in clay.",9
SCULLY,Why would he keep them in a secret room?,9
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, what is it?",4
SCULLY,What do you see?,4
SCULLY,Mulder! Can you tell me what's going on in there?,10
DOCTOR,I'm not too encouraged by what I've seen. The man is lucky to be alive.,15
PATTERSON,"Thank you, doctor. Agent Scully...",5
SCULLY,We've turned the studio upside down and there doesn't seem to be any more bodies.,15
PATTERSON,How many were recovered?,4
SCULLY,"Five. All of them dismembered, all of them young men whose faces were mutilated. Just like the latest victim here.",20
PATTERSON,At least this one is still alive.,7
NEMHAUSER,Same signature mutilation right down to the choice of weapon by the look of it.,15
SCULLY,What does Patterson have to say?,6
NEMHAUSER,I haven't spoken to him yet. But I bet he's going to come around to the idea that it's someone working directly with Mostow.,24
SCULLY,"Well, I'd have to agree with that theory.",8
NEMHAUSER,What's Agent Mulder think?,4
SCULLY,He thinks our finding Mostow's secret gallery isn't going to do him any favors with Patterson.,16
NEMHAUSER,"Well, between you and me, I think Patterson secretly went to Skinner and requested Mulder on this case.",18
SCULLY,He requested him?,3
NEMHAUSER,"I've worked with Patterson for three years on this. And this just about killed him, until we finally got a break and arrested Mostow. Then this first copy cat murder... It threw him for a loss.",36
SCULLY,Mulder's under the impression that Patterson never thought too highly of hm.,12
NEMHAUSER,"No. That's just Patterson. Late at night, with a few beers in him, he starts telling me Mulder stories. He's some kind of crack genius.",25
SCULLY,Stitches? What happened?,3
NEMHAUSER,Mostow. He bit me during the arrest.,7
PATTERSON,How's our victim? Has he been able to ID his attacker?,11
NEMHAUSER,Doctor says it's still too early to try.,8
PATTERSON,I'm not even sure he's going to make it.,9
PATTERSON,Where's Mulder?,2
SCULLY,He was going to see what he could find out about these drawings of Mostow's.,15
PATTERSON,What's he looking for?,4
SCULLY,"I think the same thing you are, sir. A second killer.",11
DOCTOR,I think you should continue this conversation outside.,8
DOCTOR,Stay with us.,3
MULDER,"The name is from the French ""gargouille"". The name of a medieval dragon that prowled the river Seine. Whose horrible image became the symbol of the soul of the condemned. Turned to stone. Or of the devils and demons of the underworld spared eternal damnation. The embodiment of the lesser forces of the universe who inspired dread, the threat of our own damnation. Ushers into hell or into the realm of our own dark fears and imagination. For over 1200 years, this grotesque image has found its expression in stone, clay, wood, oil and charcoal. Born again and again as if resurrecting itself by its own will through tortured human expression, almost as if it existed. Haunting men inwardly so that it may haunt mankind for eternity. As it must have haunted John Mostow. But what impulses moved it to kill? Could this be the same dark force at work? Its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh? Of the very hand that creates it? Is this evil something born in each of us? Crouching in the shadow of every human soul waiting to emerge? A monster waiting to violate our bodies and twist our will to do its bidding? Is this the monster called madness?",206
PATTERSON,They're closing up in a few minutes.,7
PATTERSON,"So... is this how you're looking for the second killer? Really, Mulder. What do you expect to find here?",19
MULDER,I'm not sure yet.,4
PATTERSON,But you must have some idea. Some kind of theory.,10
MULDER,I have a few theories. I'm just trying to stitch them together right now.,14
PATTERSON,With your face stuck in a library book.,8
MULDER,"You said it yourself. If you want to know the artist, look at the art. I'm finally agreeing with you.",20
PATTERSON,"I know where you're going with this, Mulder. Because I've been there myself. So I can tell you you're wasting your time.",22
MULDER,Maybe you can also tell me why this man was compelled to sculpt and draw the same face again and again. Why he's still doing it now.,27
PATTERSON,Because he's insane.,3
PATTERSON,This is the scrawling of a mad man.,8
MULDER,He said that this thing wants to see his own reflection.,11
PATTERSON,Mostow has said everything but what I need to hear. The name of his accomplice.,15
MULDER,Unless he's telling the truth.,5
PATTERSON,"About being possessed? I have to tell you, I'm really disappointed in you.",13
MULDER,"Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you by not disappointing you.",11
PATTERSON,"After all this time I thought you finally put your feet back on the ground. Clearly, I was mistaken.",19
SCULLY,"Mulder? Mulder, its me.",4
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MOSTOW'S SECRET GALLERY 3,40 AM,2
SCULLY,"I was scared, Mulder. I didn't know where you were. I kept trying your cell phone but you didn't answer.",20
MULDER,It was turned off.,4
SCULLY,You turned your phone off? Why do you even bother carrying it?,12
EMT,"We're all set. You ought to see a doctor some time, in case of infection.",15
SCULLY,Thanks.,1
EMT,Sure.,1
SCULLY,You still haven't told what you were doing in Mostow's studio.,11
MULDER,I was working.,3
SCULLY,"AT 3:30 in the morning? Mulder, I haven't seen or spoken to you in almost two days. You haven't been returning my calls--",23
MULDER,"This thing exists, Scully. It's real.",6
SCULLY,It? What are you talking about?,6
MULDER,Whatever keeps killing those young men.,6
SCULLY,"Mostow killed those men, Mulder, and out of some sick alliance some other person is continuing where he left off.",20
MULDER,Whoever attacked me wasn't a person.,6
SCULLY,"Well, did you actually see it? Mulder, maybe you're seeing what you want to see.",15
MULDER,"What makes you think I'd want to see that? I didn't imagine it, Scully.",14
SCULLY,"Listen to yourself, Mulder. Listen to what you're saying. You're starting to sound like...",14
SCULLY,"Look, when I couldn't reach you, I went to your apartment.",11
SCULLY,"I saw your new wallpaper. Don't you realize what is happening here, Mulder? He is testing you. He is the reason you were brought on this case in the first place.",31
MULDER,Patterson?,1
SCULLY,He requested your involvement through Skinner's office. I checked the 302 myself.,12
SCULLY,Mulder... where are you going?,5
PATTERSON,"So, how's Mulder holding up?",5
SCULLY,"Sir, can I have a minute?",6
PATTERSON,Of course.,2
SCULLY,In private?,2
PATTERSON,What's this about?,3
SCULLY,Maybe you can tell me... I'm curious about what you're doing concerning Agent Mulder.,14
PATTERSON,I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.,9
SCULLY,"I think you do, sir. I think you knew exactly how Agent Mulder would respond when you brought him on this case. You did request him, didn't you?",28
PATTERSON,"If you're concerned about Agent Mulder's conduct or behavior, maybe you should take that up with him.",17
SCULLY,You know I already have.,5
PATTERSON,Then what do you expect me to do?,8
SCULLY,I just want you to be honest with me about what you're trying to do. Is this some kind of a payback for what happened eight years ago? Because Mulder quit the ISU?,33
PATTERSON,My motivations aren't that petty.,5
SCULLY,Then why?,2
PATTERSON,I asked for Mulder because... I want to close the book on this God-forsaken case once and for all.,19
SCULLY,And you knew that he could help you solve it.,10
PATTERSON,"My advice to you, Scully... Let Mulder do what he needs on this case. Don't get in his way and don't try to hold him back, because you won't be able to.",32
MULDER,Why didn't it kill me like it killed the others? Why did it let me live?,16
MOSTOW,I could never tell you why. You would not understand.,10
MULDER,"Then help me understand, John.",5
MOSTOW,Please! Go away.,3
MULDER,No.... You have to help me go deeper. You have to help me get inside his head. Just how he got inside yours so I can find out what it wants.,31
MOSTOW,It knows what it wants.,5
MULDER,It wants to kill innocent young men by carving up their faces?,12
MOSTOW,You have felt its hunger... like your bones rattles by its frozen breath... So you know... nothing can be done.,20
MULDER,Unless I find it...,4
MOSTOW,Then what will you do?,5
MULDER,"Just tell me how to find it, John.",8
MOSTOW,No!,1
MULDER,Just tell me how to find this thing.,8
MOSTOW,You can't find it.,4
MOSTOW,Only... It can find you...,5
MOSTOW,Maybe... it already has.,4
TECHNICIAN,"First time I struck out. All three pieces were clean. On my second try, I got lucky. I dusted it with redwop.",22
SCULLY,I'm sorry?,2
TECHNICIAN,Powder spelled backwards. It's what we call the flourescent light compodium.,11
SCULLY,It looks like a partial index.,6
TECHNICIAN,"On the left half of the handle, almost a full thumb. The placement of the prints struck me...",18
SCULLY,They're oriented how someone would have gripped the knife.,9
TECHNICIAN,Which is why I thought I had the guy. Except I wasn't as lucky as I thought. So I ran the prints against the NCIC data base.,27
SCULLY,Your message said that you identified them.,7
TECHNICIAN,We did. Turns out it's one of our own people.,10
SCULLY,An FBI agent?,3
TECHNICIAN,Your partner.,2
SCULLY,These are Mulder's prints?,4
TECHNICIAN,Yes.,1
SCULLY,Are you sure?,3
TECHNICIAN,I double checked. Why? I assumed he was the one who recovered the knife at the crime scene.,18
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
GUY,There's a table up front.,5
SCULLY,"No, that's okay. You can just throw it on the floor.",11
GUY,I need to get that.,5
GUY,Evidence....,1
GUY,"Yes, she is.",3
GUY,Agent Scully? Assistant Director Skinner has asked to see you right away.,12
SKINNER,Come in.,2
SCULLY,"You wanted to see me, sir?",6
SKINNER,Yes. Sit down.,3
SKINNER,I heard they found you in evidence. I assume you were looking for the murder weapon in this Mostow case?,20
SCULLY,"Yes, sir.",2
SKINNER,Did you find it?,4
SCULLY,"No, sir.",2
SKINNER,Is it your opinion that missing evidence is the same weapon you recovered at a crime scene today?,18
SCULLY,I'm not altogether certain.,4
SKINNER,But Agent Mulder's prints were found on it.,8
SCULLY,"Yes, sir.",2
SKINNER,Have you seen Agent Mulder or spoken to him about this?,11
SCULLY,"No, sir.",2
SKINNER,Do you have any insight into Agent Mulder's current disposition of his mental state?,14
SCULLY,"I know Agent Mulder is working very hard on this case at your request, sir.",15
SKINNER,"Are you worried about him, Agent Scully?",7
SCULLY,No... sir.,2
SKINNER,Off the record.,3
SKINNER,So am I.,3
NEMHAUSER,Yeah... this is Craig Nemhauser... Please call me right away at 555-0143. I need to talk to you right away about a possible...,23
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Scully?,1
SCULLY,Where are you?,3
MULDER,I'm at Mostow's studio.,4
SCULLY,Are you with Nemhauser?,4
MULDER,No. Should I be?,4
SCULLY,"Well, that's who I was calling. He left this number on my answering machine. He said he had to talk to me.",22
SCULLY,Mulder? Do you know where he is?,7
MULDER,I'm not sure.,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, that knife that we recovered at the crime scene, I think it's the same one that Mostow used.",19
MULDER,What makes you say that?,5
SCULLY,Because Mostow's was stolen from evidence.,6
MULDER,When?,1
SCULLY,I was hoping you could tell me. Your prints were all over it.,13
MULDER,Yeah. I examined Mostow's knife yesterday in the evidence room.,10
SCULLY,Why?,1
MULDER,Because I wanted to hold it. Wanted to see what it felt like in my hand.,16
SCULLY,"Yeah, but why?",3
MULDER,"Look... Scully, I didn't take it.",6
SCULLY,"Okay, Mulder. Listen to me carefully. I want you to stay exactly where you are. I'm going to be there in a few minutes and we're going to work this thing out together. Okay? Mulder?",35
MULDER,Yeah.,1
PATTERSON,Mulder...,1
MULDER,What are you doing here?,5
PATTERSON,What are you doing here?,5
MULDER,It's Nemhauser.,2
MULDER,"But you already knew that, didn't you? You killed him, Bill. When he suspected it was you... You killed him.",20
PATTERSON,Are you out of your mind?,6
MULDER,Not me. Not now.,4
PATTERSON,Put that gun down.,4
MULDER,Not until you tell me what you're doing here.,9
PATTERSON,What I'm doing here!,4
MULDER,Look at your hands.,4
MULDER,Now ask yourself what you're doing here.,7
PATTERSON,I'm not sure.,3
MULDER,"You're here because John Mostow stole three years of your life. Every day and every night for three years you lived and breathed the horror show that was in his head and I'm sorry... imagining everything that he imagined. Sinking deeper and deeper into the ugliness that you taught us to do. When you finally caught him, it didn't just go away, and the violence... it stayed alive inside you... til it had to come out. You didn't want to do what you were doing. You wanted to stop but you couldn't. Not by yourself. That's why you called on me in the first place, why you couldn't kill me when you had the chance.",115
SCULLY,Mulder! What the hell are you doing?,7
MULDER,"Scully, get that light off me!",6
SCULLY,"First, put the gun down.",5
MULDER,You don't understand!,3
SCULLY,Help me understand why you have a gun on Agent Patterson!,11
MULDER,"It's him, Scully.",3
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
SCULLY,"You okay, Mulder?",3
SCULLY,We should call an ambulance. His pulse is still strong.,10
MULDER,This is Agent Mulder FBI. There's a man down... gunshot wound.,11
PATTERSON,"Oh, God!",2
PATTERSON,Are you listening to me? For God's sakes! Is someone listening to me?! I didn't do it! It wasn't me! I didn't kill them! Please!!,25
MULDER,We work in the dark. We do what we can to battle the evil that would otherwise destroy us.,19
MULDER,"But if a man's character is his fate, it's not a choice but a calling. Sometimes the weight of this burden causes us to falter. From the fragile fortress of our mind. Allowing the monster without to turn within. We are left alone staring into the abyss. Into the laughing face of madness.",53
