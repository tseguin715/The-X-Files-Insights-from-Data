HALEY,What - what- what -? Hey.,4
SCULLY,What just happened? What’s happening?,5
SKINNER,I don’t know what the hell happened.,7
HALEY,"Anybody! A doctor! I need a doctor over here.. My friend’s sick here. I don’t know what’s wrong. Oh, God. He just … he just fell … Ah, man.",29
SKINNER,What the hell’s going on?,5

SKINNER,Maintain your position on the downed Beta. Find the Alpha on three.,12
AGENT READING PAPER,"Federal agents! Step aside! Oh, my God.",7
SKINNER,What is it?,3
AGENT READING PAPER,What that hell did he do to him?,8
SCULLY,What? What! What? What are you seeing?,7
SKINNER,"Come on, talk to me! Talk to me!",8
AGENT READING PAPER,It’s eating away his flesh.,5
SCULLY,What?,1
SKINNER,Haley must be carrying something lethal.,6
SCULLY,Where’s Mulder?,2
SKINNER,Mulder was on him. There’s no way he couldn’t catch him.,11
SCULLY,"Mulder, respond!",2
SKINNER,Can you find him? Zoom in. Zoom in!,8
SCULLY,"I can’t see a thing. Mulder, suspect is armed and dangerous. Pursue Alpha with extreme caution.",16
SCULLY,Mulder! Damn it!,3
SKINNER,Agent Scully!,2
MULDER,Scully.,1
SCULLY,What happened?,2
MULDER,I lost him.,3
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,He got away.,3
SCULLY,"I came in early. I wanted to take a look at the surveillance tape to make sure I wasn’t crazy. What happened out there, Mulder?",25
MULDER,"""What happened?""",2
SCULLY,"There were 12 agents yesterday in the park. We had ownership of the suspect. We were in position to make the capture and you let him get away. And from what I see now, you may have aided in his escape.",41
MULDER,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,7
SCULLY,"It’s on the video, Mulder. I can’t prove it was you, but I know what I saw. This man is a murderer. He is a terrorist. I have a report to give this morning. I expect you to give me an answer. I expect you to tell me the truth.",50
MULDER,We’re late for the hearing.,5
SKINNER,"15 hours ago, a joint FBI/CIA task force assembled to capture Jacob Steven Haley, second in command of the militia group known as New Spartans. Intelligence revealed Haley was to make an exchange of money for a quantity of automatic weapons to conduct domestic terrorist activities and to further their express goal of overthrowing the federal government. Due to reasons that are still under review, our operation failed. Jacob Steven Haley remains at large. Whereabouts unknown.",76
CIA AGENT,What about the weapons?,4
SKINNER,"An arms dealer name Cadre who died at the scene received from Haley a $50,000 bearer bond. Presumably, this was payment for weapons delivered.",24
CIA AGENT,"In other words, Haley not only got away, he got away with $50,000 worth of guns? Have we determined a cause of death? How Haley killed this man?",28
SCULLY,He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological agent.,11
CIA AGENT,What kind of toxin are we talking about?,8
SCULLY,"We don’t know. It’s affect on the dermis and the soft tissues, the rapidity of it’s action – it is not a disease known in nature. It would seem to be genetically engineered. A bioweapon.",35
CIA AGENT,How the hell did he get it?,7
CIA AGENT,"The former Soviet Union. Security on the Siberian Vector Lab is, uh, lax. It’s conceivable it was stolen, though we have no confirmation from Moscow.",25
CIA AGENT,So this is out in the ozone now? Is this stuff floating through Folger Park?,15
SCULLY,Level Four decontamination procedures were undertaken immediately. Our best indications are that exposure was limited and that the toxin was transmitted directly and not contagious.,25
CIA AGENT,How do you know that?,5
MULDER,We’re not all dead?,4
SCULLY,"At this point, we can only guess that the toxin was transmitted by liquid or gas, touch or injection.",19
CIA AGENT,"Anybody care to tell me how this guy, Haley eluded us?",11
SKINNER,"Video recon indicates Haley had an accomplice at the park. We have yet to identify who this was, or how Haley knew he was under surveillance.",26
FBI AGENT,He must have made us.,5
CIA AGENT,Could he have?,3
SKINNER,No. Every member was chosen for their lack of exposure in terrorist circles.,13
MULDER,Haley’s extremely suspicious to the point of paranoia. He’s got military training and a guerrilla mentality.,16
SKINNER,"Second only to this man. August Bremer. He’s the group's mastermind. However, there are reports that he and Haley are vying for control. This destabilization makes August Bremer our primary threat.",31
CIA AGENT,"Well, this is it. This is the scenario we’ve all been worried about, people. Now, I need maximum control of information. Nothing leaves this room. The media gets a sniff, we’re going to disavow. We are going to stop these men. We’re going to make it all go away.",49
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
USHERETTE,The show’s almost over.,4
BREMER,"One, please.",2
BREMER,Thanks.,1
BREMER,"I’d like some popcorn, please.",5
USHERETTE,"Do you want large, extra large or Jumbo large?",9
BREMER,"Could I get some fresh popcorn, please. The sign says ""Fresh Popcorn.""",12
USHERETTE,This is fresh popcorn.,4
BREMER,"No, fresh-fresh --- hot – out of the machine back there. Please. A large.",13
USHERETTE,I’ll have to make it. Probably take a minute.,9
MULDER,Yeah?,1
HALEY,You set me up.,4
MULDER,I saved your ass.,4
HALEY,Then why wasn’t I told?,5
MULDER,I didn’t know about the operation.,6
HALEY,It was your operation.,4
MULDER,No. The Justice Department got an anonymous tip. I found out a half hour before it went down. I did what I could.,23
HALEY,"You’ll have to do better than that, Mulder.",8
MULDER,"What else can I say? I-I got as much to lose here as you do. They catch you, you’ll flip me. Look, I believe in your ideals and your goals but the only reason I tolerate your methods is because the government’s are worse.",44
HALEY,Wow. What a ringing endorsement.,5
MULDER,"Hey, you came to me, remember? I mean, what more do you want from me? I’ve risked everything. I’ve given you information. My partner is seriously suspicious. If that’s not enough for you, that’s all I’ve got.",37
TEEN 1,Ain’t nobody home.,3
TEEN 2,"Eh, she’s in there. She’s just hiding or something.",9
TEEN 1,I’m thinking we could break for it right through the front doors.,12
TEEN 2,Why? I got us front row seats.,7
TEEN 1,She see us? Is she coming?,6
TEEN 2,"Hey, man.",2
SCULLY,Maybe you can tell me what’s going on.,8
MANAGER,What?,1
SCULLY,"There seems to be a problem. A man just told me you gave him keys to my room, room 130.",20
MANAGER,Who are you?,3
SCULLY,Who am I? Who is he?,6
MANAGER,"Mr. uh, Kaplan.",3
SCULLY,Mr. Kaplan.,2
MANAGER,Yes.,1
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
MANAGER,Are you the wife?,4
SCULLY,Not even close.,3
MULDER,Yeah?,1
BREMER,We’ll proceed as planned.,4
DRIVER,Agent Mulder? You coming with us?,6
SCULLY,Shi….!,1
MAN,Step out of the car.,5
SCULLY,Exactly what agency are you from? Obviously not the Office of Information.,12
CIA AGENT,"Agent Scully, take a seat.",5
SCULLY,What the hell is going on?,6
CIA AGENT,I apologize for our methods.,5
SKINNER,They may well have saved Agent Mulder’s life.,8
SCULLY,What about my life? I don’t appreciate being run off the road.,12
CIA AGENT,We had our reasons.,4
SKINNER,You’re suspicious Agent Mulder’s betrayed his country.,7
SCULLY,I don‘t know what you’re talking about.,7
CIA AGENT,"Your discretion is understandable. In point of fact, Agent Mulder’s actions are entirely honorable. What you’ve stumbled into is a classified action, a deep-cover assignment.",25
SKINNER,"Until now, Agent Mulder’s true mission was known only to the US Attorney and myself.",15
SCULLY,His true mission?,3
SKINNER,The council we sat in was front to make the New Spartans believe we were unaware of Agent Mulder’s complicity.,20
SCULLY,Why him? Why choose Agent Mulder?,6
SKINNER,We didn’t choose him. They did.,6
CIA AGENT,"He spoke at a UFO conference in Boston where he broadcast his feelings about the government and their conspiracies against the American people. Somebody from the organization was listening so the man who escaped, Haley, sent out feelers in hopes that Agent Mulder was a man whose politics were in line with his own. Someone on the inside that he could use.",62
SCULLY,To what aim?,3
SKINNER,That we don’t know.,4
SCULLY,You’ve put Agent Mulder’s life in danger by not telling me.,11
SKINNER,I advised him not to tell you. He’s at a very delicate point. Everything he does now must work to build trust.,22
SCULLY,"Including letting this man Haley get away with murder? Sir, we know nothing about this bioweapon. We don’t know what they want to use it for. We don’t even know if they have the capacity to store it safely. Putting Agent Mulder in this situation is extremely risky.",48
SKINNER,They want something from him. We have no other way of learning what.,13
AGENT,"Movie theatre in Ohio. Whatever they’re using, they’ve used it again.",11
MULDER,"Ooh. Is this the Pepsi challenge? How ’bout some, uh, fresh air, boys?",13
HALEY,"Welcome, Agent Mulder.",3
MULDER,"Okay, deal me in.",4
HALEY,This is just a little method that we use to learn the truth.,13
MULDER,"Well, you might want to put that hood back on me unless you want to see a grown man cry.",20
HALEY,What happened in the park?,5
MULDER,I told you on the phone. FINGER BREAKING MAN twists and breaks MULDER’s finger. MULDER screams in pain.),18
MULDER,"I was set up. I’m telling the truth. Wait, wait! Wait! I let you go!",15
HALEY,"You’re spying on us, aren’t you?",6
MULDER,No. No. No.,3
MULDER,You want me to lie and say yes?,8
MULDER,"I’m going to kill you, you son of a bitch! I’m going to kill you! If I set you up you think I’d even get into the car with this Nazi piece of shi…!",34
MULDER,"I risked everything! If I was lying, there’d be federal agents descending on this place like the wrath of God right now. If you touch me again, you’d better kill me!",31
HALEY,"A war is going on, Agent Mulder. Either you’re on the right side or the wrong. You’ve seen the effects of this?",22
MULDER,Yeah.,1
HALEY,Would you like to see them again?,7
MULDER,"No, I didn’t set you up. If you got set up, it was one of yours.",16
HALEY,You know what? I believe you.,6
SCULLY,What are you reading in there?,6
TECH,"We’ve been through and through. No hot zones. No atmospheric. You’re clear, Agent Scully.",14
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
SKINNER,"14 victims total, including patrons, a projectionist and an employee.",10
SKINNER,That’s the usherette. There were two survivors. Two teenage boys.,10
SKINNER,How did it happen that those two kids survived?,9
SCULLY,I don’t know. But it’s going to help us establish a method of delivery. It’s doubtful the pathogen was airborne. They found no atmospheric traces. So it’s got to be something that everybody touched.,34
SCULLY,Don’t be alarmed.,3
MULDER,"Scully, get out of here.",5
SCULLY,Mulder …,2
MULDER,Get out of here!,4
SCULLY,I know what you’re doing. Skinner told me everything.,9
MULDER,I don’t know what you’re talking about,7
SCULLY,What happened to your hand?,5
MULDER,Nothing.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, Mulder, what did they do to you? God, this needs to be set. You’re in pain.",17
MULDER,"Yeah, if you keep pulling it around like that.",9
SCULLY,Let’s get the swelling down.,5
SCULLY,"They’ve killed again, Mulder. 14 people in a movie theatre in Ohio. The same toxin they released in the park.",20
MULDER,14 people? That doesn’t make any sense.,7
SCULLY,Unless it was a test… for something bigger.,8
SCULLY,"Why do this to you, Mulder?",6
MULDER,"They’re testing me, too. Haley’s paranoid … and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.",18
SCULLY,What stopped him?,3
MULDER,They still need something from me … and I’m sensing there’s someone Haley trusts even less – The man giving him his orders. Someone I haven’t met yet. A guy named August Bremer.,33
SKINNER,What happened to your hand?,5
MULDER,Terrorist lie detector.,3
CIA AGENT,"Well, did you pass?",4
MULDER,"Well, I must have. I’m still here. They told me what they want. Documentation from the federal reserve bank. Fund transfer schedules for the eastern seaboard. Cash money.",28
CIA AGENT,They’re going to hit a bank or an armored car.,10
SKINNER,That’s it? That’s all?,4
MULDER,I think I convinced Haley that the near miss in Folger Park was due to a mole inside his own group. He wants surveillance files on them.,27
SKINNER,How soon?,2
MULDER,They’re waiting for my call.,5
SKINNER,"All right, we’ll need some time to redact. Dummy something up.",11
CIA AGENT,"No, I anticipated this. I’ve got files ready to use.",10
SKINNER,"You know, I’m getting a bad feeling about this. I want a tail on him.",15
CIA AGENT,No tail.,2
SKINNER,"Once they get what they want from Mulder, what’s to keep them from killing him?",15
CIA AGENT,"They spot a tail on him, they’re gonna shoot him on the spot. We have got no other way of learning what they want past this – What the big picture is.",32
SKINNER,You may not have another chance to contact us.,9
MULDER,If you don’t hear from me by midnight … feed my fish.,12
TECH,That’s it. That’s your bug.,5
SCULLY,It’s a bacterium.,3
TECH,An especially virulent one. We isolated it from the bearer bond.,11
SCULLY,Was the bacterium also found on the ticket stub?,9
TECH,"Actually, no. Barring the usual particles and dust mites the ticket stub was clean.",14
SCULLY,"Well, then how was the biotoxin spread throughout the theatre?",10
TECH,I don’t know.,3
SCULLY,It looks like streptococcus.,4
TECH,"A strain of streptococcus, but one that has been genetically altered to make it extraordinarily lethal.",16
SCULLY,But strep wouldn’t be able to survive any kind of exposure to the environment.,14
TECH,Normally. But whoever produced this has cleverly coded the bacterium with a synthetic protective covering. The covering gives them an adhesive quality. It’s like a scratch and sniff. Dermal contact activates the contagion. It’s ingenious in its own evil way.,40
SCULLY,Developed by the Russians?,4
TECH,I’ve seen everything in the Russian arsenal. They’ve got nothing this sophisticated.,12
SCULLY,"Well, then by whom?",4
HALEY,Do you have what we need?,6
MULDER,Tell the gimp to back off.,6
HALEY,Give me the files.,4
MULDER,I need that back by tomorrow.,6
HALEY,Lies within lies. Put the hood on. You’re going with us.,11
MULDER,No.,1
HALEY,You put it on or the gimp puts it on for you.,12
SKINNER,Skinner.,1
SCULLY,"The biotoxin was applied to the bearer bond with an aerosol spray, but there is no evidence whatsoever of it on the theatre stubs. Now, I still have no idea how these kids were unaffected.",35
SKINNER,Have you ID’d the toxin? Agent Scully?,7
SCULLY,"Sir, are you alone?",4
SKINNER,No. Why?,2
SCULLY,I’d like to speak with you in private.,8
SKINNER,You’re off the speaker.,4
SCULLY,"Thank you. Now, CIA Intelligence suggested that this biotoxin was stolen from the Russians, but my research indicates that it was almost certainly developed domestically.",25
SKINNER,"The United States has no bioweapons, Agent Scully. President Nixon dismantled our program in 1969.",15
SCULLY,"Yes, sir, that’s what we’ve been told, but the CDC database contains evidence of a streptococcus bacterium being developed by the Army’s Pine Bluff Facility in the 1960’s. It appears to be a very primitive strain of what we’re seeing here.",41
SKINNER,What are you saying?,4
SCULLY,What I’m saying is that the bioweapons program may have continued in secret and that someone may be sending Agent Mulder on a suicide mission.,25
SKINNER,Right. Thank you.,3
CIA AGENT,What is it?,3
SKINNER,She’s just .. concerned for her partner.,6
BREMER,You put us all at risk bringing him here.,9
HALEY,We took the usual precautions. Anyway he came through for us. Federal Reserve schedules for tomorrow.,16
BREMER,You’re a believer?,3
MULDER,I have my beliefs.,4
BREMER,You willing to die for them?,6
MULDER,I’d prefer it didn’t come to that.,7
BREMER,We have a job to do.,6
BREMER,You’re Dracula.,2
SCULLY,"Oh, damn. The money. Oh, my God, the money.",9
HALEY,"Mulder, take it.",3
BREMER,Make sure you point that the right way.,8
MANAGER,"Euna, can I have the keys, please?",7
BREMER,"You do what I say, or I’ll shoot you!",9
HALEY,Three minutes!,2
BREMER,Open the gate. Open it!,5
TERRORIST 1,Get down! Now! Everybody down! Now!,6
TERRORIST 2,"Don’t be foolish. Give us the money and we’ll be gone. Move back! Move it! Come on! Move it! Down! Move it! Down, here, now! Don’t touch that phone!",29
BREMER,"Dracula, take the teller.",4
MULDER,Right.,1
HALEY,Step away from the counter! Open the doors! Put your hands up on the windows now! Now! Do it! Get down!,21
TERRORIST 2,You! Here! Get down! Now! Get down!,7
HALEY,Two minutes!,2
BREMER,Let’s open it! Open it!,5
FBM,Don’t move!,2
MULDER,I got it!,3
HALEY,Is he dead?,3
MULDER,No. He’s still alive.,4
HALEY,Finish him!,2
HALEY,One minute thirty!,3
HALEY,You! Face down on the floor! Right here!,8
HALEY,What are you waiting for? Do it!,7
TERRORIST 2,Get down!,2
HALEY,I told you to finish him. Finish him!,8
BREMER,That weapon’s traceable. Go.,4
BREMER,Get the hell out of here. Go! Go!,8
MULDER,What are you doing? What are you doing?,8
BREMER,The bills could be traced.,5
MULDER,The bank heist was a decoy. To contaminate the money you didn’t take.,13
BREMER,"No more tests, Mr. Mulder. This is the real deal. You’ve been a big help.",15
HALEY,Put that down.,3
BREMER,He’s a liability now.,4
HALEY,"To who? You? If you think you’re going to kill Mulder to protect your secret, it’s too late. I already know your secret. Agent Mulder provided us with FBI surveillance reports – files which contain the name of a source who’s been leaking information on us for a period of two years – Charles Bogard. See, Bogard is an alias an old one – for August Bremer.",67
BREMER,Agent Mulder knows my alias just as he knew a false report would feed your ambition and pit you against me.,21
HALEY,Mulder risked his life for us.,6
BREMER,Are you sure about that?,5
MULDER,"They're testing me, too. Haley's paranoid... and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.",17
SCULLY,What stopped him?,3
MULDER,They still need something from me. And I'm sensing there's someone Haley trusts even less.,15
HALEY,What the hell is this?,5
SCULLY,"Director Skinner, you’ve got to get to Mulder. You’ve got to find the bank that they hit..",17
SKINNER,That’s what we’re trying to do.,6
SCULLY,Agent Mulder’s life is in danger -- and anybody else who touches the currency at that location. They’re putting the biotoxin on the money.,23
SKINNER,We’ve got no way of contacting him – not without blowing his cover.,13
SCULLY,You’ve got no choice.,4
CIA AGENT,"We had surveillance tapes satellited to us -- There have been 27 robberies in seven eastern states, all this morning.",19
SKINNER,There’s been no sign of Mulder.,6
SCULLY,"Well, he’s got to be on there somewhere.",8
BREMER,We’ve made some decisions.,4
BREMER,Take it and get out of here. I don’t want to see your face again. Go.,16
BREMER,On your feet.,3
MULDER,"I don’t need a car. You can just call me a cab, that’d be fine.",15
BREMER,Let’s go.,2
MULDER,Go where?,2
BREMER,Witnessing the murder of a federal agent will make these men an accessory to the crime.,16
MULDER,You hear that?,3
FINGER BREAKING MAN,I wouldn’t miss it for the world.,7
BREMER,Stop there. Down on your knees. Hands behind your back.,10
BREMER,There’s a car for you just over the rise. Head south ‘till you get to the highway.,17
MULDER,Who are you?,3
BREMER,"Go on. If they come out here and find us, they’ll kill us both. Go.",15
POLICE,Hey! Hold it ! Who are you?,6
MULDER,FBI. Who’s in charge? Who’s in charge? I need everybody out of the bank!,14
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,The money! They sprayed the money.,6
SCULLY,We got here an hour ago before any of the funds were touched or transferred. The cash supply is being isolated. It’s being locked down in the vault.,28
MULDER,How did you know it was this bank?,8
SCULLY,I recognized you from the surveillance tape.,7
MULDER,With the …?,3
SCULLY,Your finger.,2
MULDER,"August Bremer, or whatever his real name is – he’s working with us.",13
SCULLY,"Mulder, before you go any further you should know that the biotoxin they used may have come from government labs. Our government.",22
MULDER,You’re saying I was set up?,6
SKINNER,We have no definitive information to justify that position.,9
MULDER,I was being used? This whole operation? The people who died in that theatre?,14
CIA AGENT,Agent Mulder. Our government is not in the business of killing innocent civilians.,13
MULDER,The hell they aren’t. Those were tests on us to be used on someone else.,15
CIA AGENT,"Those bills have been analyzed. The money in the vault gave no readings. There’s absolutely no evidence of any biotoxins. So, before you climb on any bandwagon …",28
SCULLY,You knew about this all along. You knew about this the whole time!,13
MULDER,I want that money rechecked.,5
CIA AGENT,That money has been cleared. It’s being used as evidence in a federal crime.,14
MULDER,"That money’s as dirty as you are, isn’t it. Isn’t it?",11
CIA AGENT,"Say that were true. Then what do you hope to accomplish , Agent Mulder, as a whistle-blower? To mobilize a civil rights action? To bring down the federal government? To do the very work that group you were a part of is so bent on doing? What do you want? Laws against those men, or laws protecting them?",57
MULDER,I want people to know the truth.,7
CIA AGENT,Well sometimes our job is to protect those people from knowing it. Excuse me.,14
