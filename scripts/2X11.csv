TV ANNOUNCER,Danelle was an outstanding high school basketball player...,8
TIERNAN,"Come on, man. Come on. Come on, now. Put ‘em down … put ‘em down! Ow!",16
UPSHAW,"Hey, man, watch it.",4
TIERNAN,"Come on, Upshaw. Come on, you and me, buddy! Let’s go!",11
UPSHAW,"You’re a moron, Tiernan.",4
TIERNAN,Come on. Let’s go!,4
NURSE CHARTERS,"You’re both morons, as far as I’m concerned. Now who’s watching the floor?",13
UPSHAW,"What’s his name, the Skink.",5
TIERNAN,Guess who died this afternoon? Mrs. Richardson.,7
UPSHAW,"Face plant, in a bowl of pudding.",7
NURSE CHARTERS,I don’t suppose either of you changed her room.,9
UPSHAW,"Oh, no. We left that for you.",7
TIERNAN,Ow!,1
TV ANNOUNCER,"Mike Tyson, a disciple of Costanaro …",7
NURSE CHARTERS,"Okay. Party’s over, gents.",4
STAN,Why’d you do that?,4
NURSE CHARTERS,"‘Cause rules are rules, Stan. And I’m the Queen Bitch around here.",12
HAL,Gung said we could watch the rest of the fight.,10
NURSE CHARTERS,"Well, do I look like Gung to you?",8
HAL,No. You got a better figure.,6
NURSE CHARTERS,"You want to keep that hand, Hal, you better let go.",11
HAL,How about a little sponge bath?,6
NURSE CHARTERS,How about I take care of these wandering hands of yours? Come here.,13
HAL,"You like strapping me down, don’t you?",7
NURSE CHARTERS,"Oh, yeah. I really get off on it.",8
NURSE CHARTERS,"Hey, Gung. No TV after 9:00. Do you understand?",9
GUNG,Dr. Grago said they’re getting better so …,8
NURSE CHARTERS,"Oh, getting better. Right. That’s because they don’t pinch his butt every time he walks into the room.",18
NURSE CHARTERS,"No! Somebody help me! Somebody, please! Please! Please! Please!",9
NURSE CHARTERS,"Help me! Please, help me!",5
SCULLY,Good morning.,2
MULDER,"Whatever tape you found in that VCR, it isn’t mine.",10
SCULLY,Good. Because I put it back in that drawer with all those other videos that aren’t yours.,17
MULDER,"Well, this definitely isn’t mine.",5
SCULLY,"No. This is Michelle Charters. She’s a registered nurse at a convalescent home in Worchester, Massachusetts.",16
MULDER,What happened to her?,4
SCULLY,"According to Miss Charters, she was raped. The abrasions and contusions here would be consistent with her claims as would be the medical report which cites the kind of injury and tearing associated with sexual trauma.",36
MULDER,Where did you get this? Violent Crimes?,7
SCULLY,No. The woman made the video herself. It seems that no one will believe her story.,16
MULDER,Why not?,2
SCULLY,Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity. A spirit being.,14
MULDER,I have several X-Files that document similar cases.,8
SCULLY,I know. I’ve been here since 6:00 this morning going through them.,12
MULDER,"Well, then you none of them have ever been substantiated.",10
SCULLY,Not surprisingly.,2
MULDER,"Given the emotional and psychological violence of rape, the face or identity of the attacker is often blurred or erased from memory. That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap for me.",35
SCULLY,Yes. But this case is different.,6
MULDER,Why?,1
SCULLY,The victim has filed a lawsuit against the government. She seems to be certain who the spirit being is.,19
NURSE CHARTERS,Mr. Arden. Hal Arden.,4
SCULLY,And you know him …?,5
NURSE CHARTERS,He’s been a patient where I work for about five years.,11
MULDER,"Miss Charters, the facts of your case seem to contravene those of other cases we have on file.",18
NURSE CHARTERS,Right. You mean the other Woman-Raped-by-Invisible-Man cases?,7
MULDER,How do you know it was him who attacked you?,10
NURSE CHARTERS,"He made advances toward me. And he said things – rude things. Look, when you bathe somebody every day for five years you get to know more about them than you really need to. And an old man smells a certain way and he feels a certain way.",48
SCULLY,I know this is hard for you.,7
NURSE CHARTERS,"This is the easy part. You see, hard is not being able to get disability leave or workman’s comp and having to go back to work with this … guy.",30
SCULLY,To continue our investigation we’re going to need some kind of evidence – physical or …,16
NURSE CHARTERS,"Yeah, I know. I’ve heard it. Unless you have hair or semen or fibers you guys can’t build a case.",20
MULDER,That’s right.,2
NURSE CHARTERS,"Look, I didn’t make this up, okay? I was attacked. And I’m not some kind of shrinking violet who would repress the memory of a rapist’s face. If I could positively ID him or give you something to incriminate the man, I would.",43
HAL,You’ve got to be kidding me. And what do I think about her claims? I should be in the Guinness Record Book. I’m 74 years old. I’ve got plumbing older than this building. Hmmm?,34
HAL,"And it don’t work much better, either.",7
MULDER,Thank you for sharing. Are you aware you’re being named in a lawsuit against the federal government?,17
HAL,I am?,2
SCULLY,Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?,6
HAL,What?,1
SCULLY,Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?,6
HAL,"Threaten? It was harmless, for crying out loud. Ever since this *sex harassment* fad, men can’t say what’s on their minds.",21
SCULLY,She says you made advances.,5
HAL,Hmm?,1
SCULLY,Advances?,1
HAL,"If I told you you were a very pretty woman and I would like to show you some affection, would you be offended? Huh?",24
HAL,"Oh, I didn’t mean to step on your toes there.",10
MULDER,It’s all right. There seems to be some confusion here.,10
HAL,"Yeah. I though Nurse What’s-Her-Name said she was rogered by a ghost. I may have one foot in the grave, but I certainly can’t fly down hallways spreading amour.",29
MULDER,Apparently not.,2
HAL,"If that’s what it’s like … if that’s what it’s like in heaven, Lord, take me now.",17
SCULLY,"What do you think, Mulder?",5
MULDER,About the guy’s plumbing?,4
SCULLY,About his story.,3
MULDER,I think this will turn out to be a huge waste of time just like all the other X-Files on entity rape. Unsubstantiated phenomena.,24
SCULLY,But in a substantiated crime.,5
UPSHAW,"Hey, pay attention. Or you can take another bath with your clothes on. At five and a half bucks an hour I don’t give a rat's ass either way.",29
MS. DAWSON,"Ten years ago, Excelsius was a leading facility in care and treatment of the elderly. Then government funding was cut till we’re all but shut down. Only a few wings are operational now.",33
SCULLY,Is there still a medical staff?,6
MS. DAWSON,"Not on site. Dr. Grego visits three times a week. Excelsius residents are very well looked after, though. We hold ourselves to a high standard of health maintenance and treatment.",30
SCULLY,What kind of treatment?,4
MS. DAWSON,"We’ve always specialized in the care of the late-life degenerative diseases – Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s.",14
MULDER,We met with a patient today.,6
MS. DAWSON,"We prefer ""resident,"" actually.",4
MULDER,We met a *resident* who was described to us as having Alzheimer’s but he actually seemed quite spry and alert.,20
MS. DAWSON,"You’re speaking of Hal Arden, the man accused of assaulting Michelle Charters.",12
SCULLY,Was he receiving special treatment?,5
MS. DAWSON,You’d have to speak to Dr. Grago. Hal has been here almost eight years now. We’re all quite fond of him. We were extremely dismayed over this whole business with the lawsuit.,32
SCULLY,Are you saying you don’t believe Nurse Charters’ allegations of rape?,11
MS. DAWSON,There’s something I’d like to show you.,7
STAN,What did you tell them?,5
HAL,I didn’t tell them anything.,5
STAN,Why are they still here?,5
HAL,"I don’t know, Stan.",4
STAN,Now you got to be more careful.,7
HAL,I am careful.,3
STAN,"You’re going to ruin it for all of us. They find out, it all goes for nothing.",17
HAL,I didn’t tell them anything.,5
STAN,"I’m not going to die in this Godforsaken hole, you hear me?",12
HAL,"Oh, bug off, Stan.",4
HAL,Where’d you get that?,4
STAN,I know where he keeps them.,6
HAL,"Give me one, Stan. Huh? I want another one, too.",10
STAN,You can’t handle another one.,5
HAL,"Oh yeah? Maybe I’ll just rat you out, then. Huh? How would you like that?",15
SCULLY,This is Michelle Charters’?,4
MS. DAWSON,"There are three separate insurance claims for accidents received on the job. In April, she went to the State Board and requested leave with full pay due to job-related emotional stress. The request was summarily rejected. There’s more …",39
SCULLY,"I’d like to review it myself, if that’s okay?",9
MS. DAWSON,Certainly.,1
MULDER,"Ms. Dawson, did you get a chance to see Michelle after the incident? To see the extent of her injuries?",20
MS. DAWSON,I wasn’t here the night it happened but I did see her the following day.,15
MULDER,Then you know how badly she was hurt.,8
MS. DAWSON,Yes.,1
MULDER,"In your opinion, do you think she staged the attack?",10
TIERNAN,"Excuse me, Ms. Dawson? We need help. Mr. Arden’s choking to death!",12
STAN,See? See what happened? I told you you couldn’t handle any more.,12
SCULLY,Call 911. Hal. Can you speak? I think this man’s in ventricular fibrillation. I need 75 milligrams of Lidocaine and one amp of Amphinephrine. Stat.,25
TIERNAN,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,And get me a defibrillator!,5
TIERNAN,Okay.,1
SCULLY,"He’s turning cyanotic. Come on, Hal. You gotta help me.",10
MULDER,"Come on, Hal.",3
MS. DAWSON,"One, two, three, four, five.",5
UPSHAW,The ambulance is on the way!,6
SCULLY,I’m losing him. What’s taking them so long?,8
MS. DAWSON,He’s not responding! Still no pulse. Where’s that crash cart!,10
DOCTOR GREGO,Hal Arden’s been my patient since he came here eight years ago. This really is a setback.,17
SCULLY,A setback?,2
DOCTOR GREGO,Hal was part of a group of Alzheimer’s patients I’ve been treating for 11 months.,15
SCULLY,But Alzheimer’s isn’t treatable.,4
DOCTOR GREGO,It’s an experimental drug called Depranil – an enzyme inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain.,19
SCULLY,"I’ve read about it, but I’ve also read that the clinical benefits are marginal at best.",16
DOCTOR GREGO,"Yes, but these patients seem to be proving otherwise. They’ve demonstrated cognitive abilities well beyond anything that’s been reported.",19
MULDER,So he was actually getting better?,6
DOCTOR GREGO,Before he started receiving the drug he could hardly complete a sentence.,12
DOCTOR GREGO,"Look, there’s not much to get excited about in my work. Most of these people are on the downhill slide. If I can make them comfortable, maybe prolong a life, that’s about all they expect. But to reverse an illness.",40
SCULLY,Would it be possible for us to take a look at other patients in your test group?,17
DOCTOR GREGO,"Sure, if you want to.",5
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
GUNG,Where did you get that?,5
STAN,"It was Hal’s. Since he’s not here anymore, why can’t I have it?",13
GUNG,Because you have enough. What I give you is enough. It’s our secret.,13
STAN,"Oh, come on, Gung. It’s making me better.",8
GUNG,Too much is very bad Very bad. No more for you.,11
DOROTHY,"I want you to stand behind Ben, Eddie, because Ben’s taller, and I want …",15
DOCTOR GREGO,"That man there --- that’s Leo Kreutzer. During the Depression he was a WPA artist. Quite a good one too, I’m told.",21
DOROTHY,"…Hello, Mabel, don’t you look lovely. ….",7
MULDER,Is he receiving the same treatments as Hal Arden?,9
DOCTOR GREGO,"Yes. When he came to us he couldn’t draw a circle. Now, you can see for yourself.",17
DOROTHY,…Because you’re taller I want you to stand behind Ben.,10
DOCTOR GREGO,"You’ll have to excuse me, I’m already well behind on rounds.",11
SCULLY,Can I get a copy of Hal Arden’s autopsy results?,10
DOCTOR GREGO,Of course.,2
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
MULDER,"May I sit down, Leo?",5
SCULLY,"Leo, we’re with the FBI. We have some questions that we’d like to ask you.",15
DOROTHY,"Leo’s a brilliant artist, you know. Don’t be so modest, Leo. President Kennedy has one of his paintings in the White House.",22
SCULLY,Dr. Grago tells us that you haven’t been able to work in years. That the medicine has improved …,19
LEO,It ain’t the medication.,4
SCULLY,What is it then?,4
UPSHAW,"Okay, Rembrandt. 6:00. Dinner time.",5
TIERNAN,"Come on, Dorothy. Legs up and straight ahead. Don’t want you getting a flat tire.",15
DOROTHY,"Wait, Leo’s not finished with us.",6
TIERNAN,Leo can finish with you later.,6
DOROTHY,He still has to draw the rest.,7
TIERNAN,"He’ll do it later, honey.",5
UPSHAW,"Come on, Leo. Don’t make me embarrass you in front of your friends.",13
MULDER,"Come on, Scully. Let’s get out of here.",8
SCULLY,….to find not just the treatment but a cure for Alzheimer’s. Do you realize how important that would be?,19
MULDER,If it would keep anybody out of a place like that it would be important enough. I wouldn’t say those people were exactly cured.,24
SCULLY,Any progress at all …,5
MULDER,"Well, I hope someone’s making some progress ‘cause we’re going home with a big goose egg. Checking out of room 206 and 210, please.",24
CLERK,"Certainly, sir. Angelo?",3
SCULLY,What if there’s a connection?,5
MULDER,Between the rape case and the Alzheimer’s? When they’re not drawing childlike pictures they’re brutal sex offenders?,17
SCULLY,Dr. Grago’s therapy produces acetylcholine. Too much cholinergic activity causes a phychotic state similar to schizophrenia.,16
MULDER,You think that Michelle Charters was raped by an 74-year-old schizophrenic?,11
SCULLY,It’s possible.,2
MULDER,An *invisible* 74-year-old schizophrenic?,4
SCULLY,"Well, maybe it’s not in the medication. Maybe it’s the place itself.",12
MULDER,"Are you saying that the building’s haunted? If you are, you’ve been working with me for too long, Scully.",19
SCULLY,"I’m talking about an environmental reason behind what’s happening there. Even the disinfectant couldn’t mask that smell. Who knows what’s breeding behind the walls or in the sub-structure. Some fungal contaminants have been known to cause delusions, dementia, violent behaviour…",40
MULDER,Why wouldn’t it have affected the other residents?,8
SCULLY,Maybe it has.,3
MULDER,"I-I think you’re looking too hard, Scully, for something that’s not there. I think Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates.",27
SCULLY,"Her lip required 13 stitches. The blow to her head resulted in a subdural hematoma. That’s quite a concoction. Look, I just want to talk to a few more patients there. We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night.",40
TIERNAN,This is gourmet fare. Be a good girl and open wide.,11
DOROTHY,"No. Please don’t. Please, don’t.",5
TIERNAN,"Open wide. Open up, honey.",5
DOROTHY,Please don’t. I don’t want …,6
TIERNAN,"That’s fine, Dorothy. Starve to death. See if I care.",10
GUNG,"Why aren’t you eating your food, Leo? What’s the matter?",10
LEO,It’s Dorothy. She needs more. We both do.,8
GUNG,What you have is enough.,5
LEO,It’s not working for us. Not like it works for the others. We need more.,15
GUNG,"No. No. Now eat your food, please. I’ll come back and pick up your tray.",15
LEO,"It’s okay, Dorothy. Don’t worry. I think Stan had some more hidden away somewhere. It will be all right.",19
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Why are you being so stubborn?,6
STAN,I’m not. I happen to like it here.,8
STAN’S DAUGHTER,A year ago you were begging to live with us.,10
STAN,"Well, things change.",3
STAN’S DAUGHTER,"Look Dad, I am sorry about what happened to Mr. Arlen.",11
STAN,His name was Arden.,4
TIERNAN,"I’m finished packing your things, Mr. Phillips. I’m going to make sure you didn’t forget anything. Don’t you worry, Mrs. Kelly. Just pull your car around out front. I’ll make sure he gets down okay.",35
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Thank you.,2
TIERNAN,He’s going to be fine.,5
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Can I help you?,4
SCULLY,Yes. We’d like to have a word with Mr. Phillips.,10
STAN’S DAUGHTER,I’m his daughter. What is this about?,7
SCULLY,We’re with the FBI. We have a few questions concerning his medical treatment.,13
STAN’S DAUGHTER,He’s in there packing right now. I’m about to take him home. Is there anything I can help you with?,20
STAN’S DAUGHTER,My little girls won’t even visit their grandfather. They’re afraid to even come here.,14
SCULLY,"It’s hard for anyone to be here, including the residents.",10
STAN’S DAUGHTER,That’s why Jack and I decided that no matter what time he’s got left we want him to spend it with us.,22
SCULLY,How many years has he been here?,7
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Almost three. But we didn’t have any choice. Jack and I both work. The doctor said he needed 24 hour nursing assistance.,22
MULDER,He doesn’t seem to need much assistance now. Has his improvement been that pronounced?,14
STAN’S DAUGHTER,"I thought I was bringing him here to die. They told me he’d only get worse. The physical deterioration, the dementia. And now it’s like he’s a different person.",29
MULDER,Do you have any idea why?,6
STAN’S DAUGHTER,I suppose it has something to do with Dr. Grago’s treatment. Dad won’t talk to me about it. He’s just too angry. He was angry when I first brought him here in the first place. Now he’s angry that I want to take him home. I don’t know that he’s ever going to forgive me.,55
TIERNAN,"You know, I’d like to say I’m going to miss you, Stan, but the truth is, you are a royal pain in the butt.",24
TIERNAN,"Hey, where you going? Don’t make me chase you, old man.",11
TIERNAN,"Hey! What are you? A track star all of a sudden? Okay, stop messing around, Stan. You crawl back in that window right now. You crawl back in there. Don’t think I’m coming over there to get you. I’d just as soon let you fall and break your neck. Did you hear me Stan? You hear me?",57
TIERNAN,Help! Help me! Somebody help me! I’m gonna fall!,9
TIERNAN,Help!,1
MULDER,Give me your hand. Come on.,6
TIERNAN,I can’t.,2
MULDER,Grab it.,2
STAN’S DAUGHTER,"Oh, my God.",3
DOCTOR GREGO,They paged me this morning. I got a message an orderly fell out a fourth floor window?,17
MULDER,Apparently. Either that or he was pushed.,7
DOCTOR GREGO,Was Stan involved?,3
MULDER,That’s what we’re trying to determine. Stan was with him just prior to the accident.,15
DOCTOR GREGO,You’re not suggesting he could have done it.,8
MULDER,There have been two deaths here in the past 24 hours. Stan’s been present before both of them.,18
DOCTOR GREGO,"No, no. That’s impossible. Stan Phillips has a degenerative hip disease. There’s no way, he couldn’t get up to the fourth floor on his own.",25
MULDER,What about an elevator?,4
DOCTOR GREGO,The elevators in this place haven’t worked for years.,9
MULDER,Maybe he was helped.,4
DOCTOR GREGO,Helped? By whom?,3
MULDER,I don’t know. The postmortem on Hal Arden – did you get it yet?,14
DOCTOR GREGO,"No, not yet, but they promise they’ll fax it today.",10
MULDER,Can we check and see if it’s come in yet?,10
DOCTOR GREGO,Sure. Just what do you expect to find?,8
MULDER,"I’m not sure, exactly.",4
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Why are they questioning him?,5
SCULLY,It’s routine procedure.,3
STAN’S DAUGHTER,Are they going to want to keep him here?,9
SCULLY,You’ll have to ask Dr. Grago.,6
STAN’S DAUGHTER,I … God. If my mother was alive …,9
NURSE CHARTERS,How can I handle the whole floor by myself?,9
MS. DAWSON,"I don’t know, Michelle. I have other things to deal with.",11
NURSE CHARTERS,"Yes, well, so do I. I would just like some help, please.",12
MS. DAWSON,You’re the only one on?,5
NURSE CHARTERS,Yes. Upshaw never showed up for work last night. Nobody’s listening to me around here. I said there was something going on and I told you it had to do with Mr. Arden and Mr. Phillips. Forget it.,38
MS. DAWSON,Can you please explain to me what’s going on around here?,11
DOROTHY,Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Go away! Leave me alone. Go back! Don’t come any closer!,15
MS. DAWSON,"Go back in your room, Dorothy. If you need something, I’ll send an orderly to see you.",17
DOROTHY,"No, they’re in there.",4
MS. DAWSON,Who?,1
DOROTHY,All of them.,3
SCULLY,"There’s nobody in your room, Dorothy.",6
DOROTHY,"Here they come. You’ll see. All right, now you be nice. I don’t want any more of your dirty tricks.",20
SCULLY,Is she going to be all right?,7
DOROTHY,"No! No, no, no, I don’t want to go back in there! No! No! I don’t want to go back in there! Oh, no, no, no …",27
MS. DAWSON,It’s senile dementia. This is just an episode.,8
(DOROTHY’S POV ON SCULLY,SCULLY is surrounded by shadowy figures reaching out to touch her. SCULLY stands staring at DOROTHY.),16
DOROTHY,"You leave her be. Don’t you touch her. Now shoo! Go away, go away! Don’t you get any ideas, mister.",20
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
DOROTHY,Now don’t you follow her.,5
DOCTOR GREGO,This is it.,3
MULDER,Is the toxicology there?,4
DOCTOR GREGO,Yes. There’s something here that shouldn’t be here.,8
MULDER,What’s that?,2
DOCTOR GREGO,Ibotenic acid. How did that get in his blood?,9
MULDER,What’s ibotenic acid?,3
DOCTOR GREGO,"If I’m not mistaken, it’s a kind of poison.",9
SCULLY,Mulder …,2
MULDER,"Scully, Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood. Somebody poisoned him.",12
SCULLY,"Well, not necessarily. This is only a trace amount but small amounts are known to cause hallucinations which is what one of your patients is having right now down the hall.",31
DOCTOR GREGO,Where did they get it?,5
NURSE CHARTERS,Excuse me. You’ve got to come quickly.,7
SCULLY,"Oh, my God.",3
MULDER,It’s fantastic.,2
DOCTOR GREGO,What’s going on here?,4
SCULLY,Leo?,1
SCULLY,It’s incredible …,3
MULDER,You’ve got an Asian orderly working here. What’s his name?,10
DOCTOR GREGO,"Uh, Gung, I think.",4
MULDER,Do you know where he is?,6
DOCTOR GREGO,Somewhere down in the basement.,5
MULDER,Upshaw.,1
GUNG,I didn’t kill him.,4
MULDER,"But it’s your mushroom crop, isn’t it?",7
GUNG,Yes.,1
MULDER,Who else would have buried him there?,7
SCULLY,Why were you growing them?,5
GUNG,For medicinal purposes.,3
SCULLY,Were you feeding them to the residents here?,8
GUNG,"Yes, but only in small amounts.",6
MULDER,Why?,1
GUNG,Because it makes them feel better.,6
MULDER,"Makes them feel better, or it kills them?",8
GUNG,No.,1
DOCTOR GREGO,Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they?,7
GUNG,It’s from my prefecture in my country. They’ve been used for centuries.,12
SCULLY,For what purpose?,3
GUNG,"In my country, our customs are different.",7
MS. DAWSON,You’re not in your country now. You’re hired here to care for these people under our guidelines.,17
GUNG,"Where I come from, many generations live under one roof. As children, our grandparents live with us. We feel a duty to take care of them. It isn’t like that in this country. We respect our old people as we respect our ancestors. We don’t send them away to die like Stan and Hal.",54
DOCTOR GREGO,These people are given excellent medical care.,7
GUNG,But they’re not treated with respect. Hal’s family never came to visit him once and the orderlies … treat the residents worse than dogs.,24
MS. DAWSON,No one is mistreated here.,5
GUNG,You’re not here to see.,5
MULDER,"All right, Gung, who killed the orderly? Who buried him in that room?",13
GUNG,"Something has gone very wrong. The mushrooms we take to speak with the dead, to see our ancestors in the spirit world. But … the spirit in this place is very angry and the souls that died here continue to suffer. And now they … have been awakened.",48
SCULLY,"Are you saying that a spirit killed this man, Upshaw?",10
GUNG,Yes. They’ve taken revenge for their mistreatment.,7
MULDER,How are the mushrooms taken?,5
GUNG,"Dried, mixed with many herbs, made into powder.",8
MULDER,"Well, I think the first thing we should do is make sure nobody else takes them. You, check on the other patients. Gung, come with me. Let’s go.",28
GUNG,Someone’s taken them all.,4
MULDER,"I think you’re right, Scully.",5
SCULLY,About?,1
MULDER,"What’s been happening is the result of the medication, but not the medication the Doctor’s been giving them.",18
SCULLY,"Mulder, mushrooms aren’t medication. They taste good on hamburgers, but they don’t raise the dead.",15
MULDER,Shamans have used them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world.,13
SCULLY,I think you’ve been reading too much Carlos Castenada.,9
MULDER,Ask any anthropologist then.,4
SCULLY,"I know --- a shaman gets intoxicated, he has dreams or hallucinations, and he interprets them. I don’t think it’s any more magical than that.",24
MULDER,I don’t know how else to explain what’s happening here.,10
SCULLY,"Well, I think, if anything, these mushrooms are a poison to the system and I think that’s what killed Hal Arden.",21
MULDER,"And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies? Something’s been unleashed here, Scully. I don’t know how to explain it, but it has something to do with those pills.",30
STAN’S DAUGHTER,"Daddy? Daddy, what are you taking? What are you putting in your mouth?",13
DOROTHY,"Go away! You go away! Go away! You leave me … leave us alone! Go on! You … run. Run while you can. Go on, run. Run. Go away. Go away! Go on. You leave us alone. Go on.",39
LEO,Dorothy! I need your help!,5
DOROTHY,Leo …. you leave me alone. You leave him alone! Leo! Leo! Leo … go on. Go on. You leave him …. you leave …..,25
DORORTHY,"Oh … oh, no. Stop. Stop that.",7
NURSE CHARTERS,"Help me, please.",3
SCULLY,Mulder! What’s going on!? Mulder!? Mulder!,6
MULDER,Scully! Turn off the water main! Turn off the water main!,11
SCULLY,They’re trapped in the bathroom and it’s filling with water.,10
MS. DAWSON,What?,1
SCULLY,Where’s the main water shutoff?,5
MS. DAWSON,I don’t know.,3
SCULLY,Gung will know. Keep trying the door.,7
MULDER,You’ve got to get up. Come on. You got to get up.,12
GUNG,It’s stuck.,2
SCULLY,See if you can find something to force it with.,10
GUNG,Okay.,1
MULDER,I can’t open the drains.,5
STAN’S DAUGHTER,"Please! Please, my father needs help. My father took something. I’m afraid he’s dying.",14
SCULLY,You stay with him. I’ll get help. Dr. Grago! Dr. Grago.,11
DOCTOR GREGO,It’s sealed tight.,3
SCULLY,Do you have any atropine in your kit here?,9
DOCTOR GREGO,"Uh, I might. Yes, I think so.",7
SCULLY,Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions. I think he might have poisoned himself.,13
MULDER,Just hold on. It’s all right.,6
DOROTHY,They’re gone. They’re all gone. They’re gone. They’re all gone.,10
