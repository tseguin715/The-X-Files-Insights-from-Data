MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Charlie! Come on, Charlie. Here you go, sweetie.",8
STEVE HOLVEY,"Charlie, hey! Ice cream! Hey buddy, you want some ice cream? Huh? Here, Charlie. Here you go.",17
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Look. There it goes.,4
STEVE HOLVEY,There goes your balloon.,4
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Going to balloon land. Go bye-bye. Oh, sweetie. Don't cry.",10
STEVE HOLVEY,"Hey, look! Here's some ice cream! Here's some ice cream! Want some ice cream? Look.",15
STEVE HOLVEY,Teddy. Teddy. Here's your balloon. Look at that.,8
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Shhh! Oh, such a mess. We gotta clean you up.",10
STEVE HOLVEY,Charlie and I will wait for you.,7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,You're amazing.,2
CHARLIE,That was my balloon.,4
STEVE HOLVEY,Eat your ice cream before it melts.,7
CHARLIE,I don't want any ice cream. I want my balloon.,10
STEVE HOLVEY,"We'll get you a balloon, OK?",6
CHARLIE,"No, I want my balloon.",5
STEVE HOLVEY,Fine. We'll get you another balloon. That was a waste of good money.,13
MAGGIE HOLVEY,There we go. Yes. Yes.,5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"There we go. That's a boy. Good boy. OK. OK, Teddy. I'll be right back, OK?",16
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"There were six in a bed and the little one said ""Roll over! Roll over!"" So they all rolled over and one fell out. Five in the bed and the little one said ""Roll over! Roll over!""...",37
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"... And they all rolled over and one fell out. Four in the bed and the little one said, ""Roll over! Roll over!""...",22
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"... So they all rolled over and one fell out. Three in the bed and the little one said, ""Roll over! Roll over!"" So they all rolled over and one fell out. Two in the bed and the little one said ""Roll... """,41
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Teddy? Teddy?! Teddy?! Teddy?! Teddy?!,5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Teddy?! Teddy?!,2
MAN,There's a kid on the track!,6
STEVE HOLVEY,Oh my God! Teddy! Teddy! Get away from there!,9
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Teddy!,1
STEVE HOLVEY,Come here!,2
STEVE HOLVEY,Teddy!,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Teddy, get off of the tracks!",6
STEVE HOLVEY,No!!!,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Oh my God!!!,3
STEVE HOLVEY,Maggie... Teddy...,2
MULDER,"This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago. The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two. He was killed just seconds after this was taken.",31
SCULLY,How?,1
MULDER,"According to the police report, he wandered onto the tracks of the park's miniature train. The conductor was unable to stop due to a malfunction in the braking system. Teddy's father works for the State Department, so a coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the accident.",50
SCULLY,And did the inquest come up with anything unusual?,9
MULDER,"No. No, but the County Medical Examiner called me afterwards. He was disturbed by this case and by this photograph, and I think with good reason. You see, this is a helium balloon here, and the one thing I did learn in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up, up and away, but you see this is moving away from him, horizontally.",65
SCULLY,Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?,7
MULDER,"Well, I called the National Weather Service and they said on the day that Teddy died the wind was blowing north. But you see, the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.",37
SCULLY,Pulled? By whom?,3
MULDER,"I don't know. That's why I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging. Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a simple photographic print.",25
DR. BURK,"Not details - information. Watch the monitor. We have limitations on how much information the eye can perceive unaided, but with this special software - which I designed - we can, uh, depict hidden information. We can manipulate it. Enhance it. Now watch right here. There it is.",45
DR. BURK,There's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.,7
SCULLY,"So you're saying that, uh, a ghost killed Teddy Holvey. Has anyone checked the camera that took this photo - the lens or the pressure plate?",25
MULDER,"It all checked out, Scully. I think from the information here, this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.",19
SCULLY,"Mulder, this information is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the, in the foliage of an elm tree. It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.",34
MULDER,"In order to get on those tracks, Teddy Holvey had to escape this child-proof halter that his mother had tied to a bathroom sink.",24
SCULLY,I've seen some pretty slippery two-year-olds.,6
MULDER,"So the C.M.E. took it home and put it on his own two-year-old and found it was physically impossible for the kid to reach around and free himself, so unless Teddy Holvey was the reincarnation of Houdini - and that would be an X-file in itself...",45
MAGGIE HOLVEY,I don't understand. There's already been a formal inquest.,9
MULDER,We're here apart from that investigation. We have reason to believe something may have been overlooked.,16
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Like what?,2
MULDER,The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.,10
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Oh my God.,3
STEVE HOLVEY,There were over a hundred witnesses. We saw Teddy ourselves. He was chasing a balloon. There was no one else around...,21
STEVE HOLVEY,... It was an awful accident. But that's all it was - an accident.,12
MULDER,Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?,14
MAGGIE HOLVEY,He was just a baby. Why would anybody want to hurt him?,12
STEVE HOLVEY,"Look, I don't know what you're getting at. We loved Teddy. If you're suggesting that this is anything like that woman who drowned her kids in the lake, you're way out of line.",33
MULDER,"Mrs. Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?",13
MAGGIE HOLVEY,I already told the inquest. I heard nothing.,8
SCULLY,"Mrs. Holvey, at the time of the accident, did you have any hired help?",14
MAGGIE HOLVEY,No. My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.,12
MULDER,"Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening around the house, uh, things moved, odd objects appearing, anything like that?",24
STEVE HOLVEY,It's that damn smoke detector. I'll be right back.,9
MULDER,Ah... does this happen often?,5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,It's an old house. We have a problem with the wiring.,11
GOLDA,Diavol lol... diavol lol... nu ieste el cauza.,8
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Mother!,1
GOLDA,Diavol lol.,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Mother, it was just a false alarm.",7
GOLDA,No. Asea este problema ta baiatul este blestemat.,8
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Mother.,1
GOLDA,Ye dracul!,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Stop it!,2
SCULLY,What is she saying?,4
STEVE HOLVEY,Maggie!,1
GOLDA,You marry a devil. You have devil child!,8
STEVE HOLVEY,I'm sorry.,2
MULDER,You recognize this?,3
SCULLY,"Sure, it's a swastika.",4
MULDER,"It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot. It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck. It's been used by various cultures since the middle ages. The Holvey's child had one on the back of his hand last night. My guess it was drawn there by the old lady, to protect the boy.",56
SCULLY,You're right. I saw her drawing it.,7
MULDER,And you didn't think that was strange?,7
SCULLY,"Well, I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get - but just not from ghosties or beasties. Take a look at this. Have you ever heard of Munchausen by Proxy?",33
MULDER,"Yeah, my grandfather used to take that for his stomach.",10
SCULLY,"It's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status. If you take a look at Teddy Holvey's medical history, you'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years that he was alive. That's once every three months.",58
MULDER,Projectile vomiting at three months. Diarrhea at four months. Vomiting... diarrhea... diarrhea.,12
SCULLY,Each time they were unable to determine the cause of the illness.,12
MULDER,And no one questioned this?,5
SCULLY,"Well, the family moved around a lot because of Steve's job, and records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital. But this kind of abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.",41
MULDER,"Charlie had medical problems, too?",5
SCULLY,"Since his brother was born, which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in. Often the perpetrator of Munchausen by Proxy will view the child as evil. The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.",41
MULDER,"Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?",13
STEVE HOLVEY,"Things have been strained since Golda - my mother-in-law - moved in with us. I met Maggie in Romania in 1984. Golda forbade our marriage - said I was the devil. After I transferred back to the U.S., things got somewhat better, until Teddy was born and she came to live with us. That's when the strangeness really started.",56
MULDER,What kind of strangeness?,4
STEVE HOLVEY,"Superstitions rule Golda's life. She'll spit when anyone compliments the kids. Once she moved in with us, she started pouring hot water over the threshold to ward off demons, tying red strings around the kids' wrists. One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof. Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick - a lot.",56
SCULLY,And you suspect Golda?,4
STEVE HOLVEY,"She'll call Charlie evil right to his face. But at the same time, she dotes on him like she's afraid of him.",22
MULDER,Afraid of him or for him?,6
STEVE HOLVEY,I just don't know.,4
SCULLY,Are you familiar with Munchausen by Proxy?,7
STEVE HOLVEY,Are you accusing us of child abuse?,7
SCULLY,Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.,7
STEVE HOLVEY,"I can never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.",26
SCULLY,"I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr. Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.",14
STEVE HOLVEY,Oh boy. This is gonna be hard.,7
STEVE HOLVEY,Maggie!,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,What do they want? To take Charlie away from here?,10
STEVE HOLVEY,They just want him to talk to the social worker. She's expecting him.,13
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Social worker? You know them. They'll put lies into Charlie's head.,11
STEVE HOLVEY,You're being unreasonable.,3
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"You want to take him away from me. You blame me for Teddy, and now you want to take him away from me.",23
STEVE HOLVEY,"I'm not gonna listen to this. This is ridiculous. If you want to come, you can, but I'm taking Charlie now.",21
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"No, Steven. He's my son, too.",6
SCULLY,What was that?,3
STEVE HOLVEY,There's nothing more to say.,5
GOLDA,nan,1
STEVE HOLVEY,"Come on, Charlie. Let's get your coat.",7
GOLDA,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,You have no right to do this!,7
STEVE HOLVEY,Maggie. Come on. We'll meet you out front.,8
STEVE HOLVEY,OK. You buckled in there?,5
CHARLIE,Yeah.,1
STEVE HOLVEY,Good. Damn it.,3
CHARLIE,No! No! Daddy! No! No!,5
CHARLIE,Daddy! No! Daddy! No!,4
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
CHARLIE,Daddy! No! Daddy! No! Daddy! Daddy!,6
POLICEMAN,See this?,2
SCULLY,Find anything?,2
MULDER,"Yeah, maybe.",2
SCULLY,Looks like ash.,3
MULDER,Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this.,6
SCULLY,The Holveys said earlier that they had some problems with the wiring of the house. It could be from the motor shorted out...,23
MULDER,"No, I checked the motor. It's working fine.",8
SCULLY,"Well, what do you think it is?",7
MULDER,"I don't know, but I'm gonna have this analyzed.",9
SCULLY,"Well, before we do anything, I think we should get Charlie out of this house. I just put a call into a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.",32
MULDER,"Uh, the courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters.",10
SCULLY,Not when a child is in danger... and not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.,20
MULDER,"Really? You still think this is Munchausen by Proxy, Scully?",10
SCULLY,Without a doubt. What did you do?,7
MULDER,I didn't do anything.,4
GOLDA,Stay away from our house!,5
MULDER,Hey. You want to see something weird?,7
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,"Chem-lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey's house. No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.",20
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,"It contains nothing organic or inorganic. In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist. Come on.",18
SCULLY,Where are we going?,4
MULDER,To get a second opinion.,5
DR. BURK,"Oh, wow. Haven't seen this for a while. Not since India, 1979.",12
SCULLY,India?,1
MULDER,"Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia, he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.",19
DR. BURK,"It's called vibuti - holy ash. Technically, it's known as an apport - something that materializes out of thin air.",18
SCULLY,Wait a second. Nothing just materializes out of thin air.,10
DR. BURK,You've read the Bible? You remember the story about Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?,16
SCULLY,"Yeah, but that was a parable.",6
DR. BURK,"In 1979, I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.",17
SCULLY,Too bad you didn't take a picture. You could have run it through your computer and seen the entire Last Supper.,21
DR. BURK,"Vibuti is, uh, created during the presence of spirit beings, or during bilocation, which is, uh, a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.",28
MULDER,That energy could have been what set off the garage door opener.,12
DR. BURK,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"Yeah, that or somebody activated the remote control.",8
MULDER,"Well, who are you suggesting did that?",7
SCULLY,"Well, who was standing outside when the garage door opened unexpectedly on us yesterday?",14
MULDER,The old lady... and Charlie.,5
KAREN KOSSEFF,Mrs. Holvey? My name is Karen Kosseff. I'm a social worker with the FBI. I've been instructed to file a report for the court. May I come in?,28
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"No. Please, I've already had enough trouble.",7
KAREN KOSSEFF,"I understand, Mrs. Holvey, but if you won't talk to me, I'm going to have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.",29
CHARLIE,Mommy!,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Charlie?,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Oh my God! Charlie? It's OK, Charlie. It's OK. It's OK, Charlie. It's OK. He's been sick. My mother was supposed to be looking after him.",26
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Mother! Mother!,2
GOLDA,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Get out of my house.,5
GOLDA,nan,1
FIRST MAN,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Get out!,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"I have had enough, Mother. I want you out of my house.",12
GOLDA,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,No! Mother! Mother!,3
GOLDA,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Mother!,1
KAREN KOSSEFF,Agent Scully. The grandmother's taken the child. She's locked him in the room with her. She may have a knife. I've called 9-1-1.,23
MULDER,What happened?,2
KAREN KOSSEFF,There were three strange men. They were performing some kind of ritual.,12
CHARLIE,"No! No, Nana!",3
GOLDA,Mihai! Mihai! Mihai! It is the only way.,8
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Mama!,1
CHARLIE,Esiti din mina trup periti.,5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Oh my God! Mama! Mama!,5
MULDER,Did you talk to Charlie?,5
SCULLY,"He says he doesn't remember anything. Now, the coroner's preliminary report states that she died of a heart attack... but those wounds, Mulder, I'd swear it looked like her eyes were pecked out.",33
MULDER,"Well, there was more ash on the floor under the old woman's body, and look at this.",17
SCULLY,What is it?,3
MULDER,It's mugwort. I think it's a ceremonial herb.,8
SCULLY,You think this was a ritual killing?,7
MULDER,No. The reverse swastika on the window and the red string around Charlie's wrist - those are protective devices.,18
SCULLY,Protection against what?,3
MULDER,"I don't know, but I think the old woman knew the family was in trouble, and those men were here doing a ritual to help her.",26
MAGGIE HOLVEY,I told you before. Get out of my house!,9
FIRST MAN,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,I am not interested in your superstition. Now get out. Now!!!,11
SCULLY,Mrs. Holvey?,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,It's all right.,3
MULDER,Who are they?,3
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"They are the Calusari. In Romania, they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.",16
SCULLY,What did he say?,4
MAGGIE HOLVEY,He said it's not over. The evil is still here.,10
MULDER,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,"Sir? Can I have a word with you? Sir, I'm with the FBI. I'd like to ask you some questions.",20
MULDER,"You were trying to protect the family, weren't you? You said there was still evil here. Sir? I can arrest you if I have to.",25
HEAD CALUSARI,"The evil that is here has always been. It has gone by different names through history - Cain, Lucifer, Hitler. It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men. If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.",45
MULDER,"Mrs. Holvey? I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.",19
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"My mother used to say that evil follows evil. Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck. I used to think that was just a superstition. Now I don't know what to believe. I blamed her, you know. for all that's happened. I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.",57
SCULLY,Punish you for what?,4
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"For abandoning the old ways. I was raised to believe as she did, in spirits, the unseen world. When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.",32
MULDER,Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?,11
MAGGIE HOLVEY,She was trying to cleanse the house of evil. She thought Charlie was responsible somehow. How could he be responsible for all this horror? He's just a little boy.,29
SCULLY,I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.,16
KAREN KOSSEFF,Charlie? I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday. Can you tell me about it? Do you remember how you got there?,25
CHARLIE,No.,1
KAREN KOSSEFF,Your mother said you were there. Don't you remember?,9
CHARLIE,I wasn't there.,3
KAREN KOSSEFF,Many people saw you in the room.,7
CHARLIE,It wasn't me! I wasn't there! It wasn't me!,9
KAREN KOSSEFF,Who was in the room?,5
CHARLIE,No!,1
KAREN KOSSEFF,Was there someone else in the room?,7
CHARLIE,No! I didn't hurt her!,5
KAREN KOSSEFF,Charlie? Charlie? Who hurt your grand... Charlie?,7
CHARLIE,It was him!,3
KAREN KOSSEFF,"Who? Charlie, who?",3
CHARLIE,It was Michael! Michael! Michael!,5
SCULLY,Mrs. Holvey?,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,We never told him. It was agreed upon. It was our secret.,12
MULDER,"What secret, Mrs. Holvey? What are you talking about?",9
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Michael. He was Charlie's twin. He was stillborn. Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it. My mother, she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death, to divide their souls. She said if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie. But it was just a superstition.",57
KAREN KOSSEFF,Charlie? Help! I need your help!,6
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Charlie?,1
KAREN KOSSEFF,He's having some kind of siezure.,6
SCULLY,"Don't restrain him. Let's turn him on his side so he doesn't aspirate. Charlie, you're going to be OK.",19
MULDER,How's Charlie?,2
SCULLY,He's resting. How's Mrs. Holvey?,5
MULDER,"I'm amazed she hasn't broken down completely. She's in the waiting room, trying to get some sleep.",17
SCULLY,"The doctor said that Charlie had some kind of a siezure, but they've been unable to determine a cause.",19
NURSE CASTOR,"Oh, I'm sorry Charlie, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Nurse Castor. Now, I'm just gonna give you a little something to help you sleep.",26
CHARLIE,"No, I don't want a shot.",6
NURSE CASTOR,"I know, but that's what happens when you spit out your medicine. We have to give it to you some other way.",22
CHARLIE,No!,1
NURSE CASTOR,"Now, Charlie, I just want you to relax. It's not gonna hurt, and afterwards I'll give you a sucker.",19
CHARLIE,Leave me alone!,3
NURSE CASTOR,"Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch. Now, I want you to relax.",13
CHARLIE,Stop it!,2
NURSE CASTOR,"Charlie, now, I want you to behave.",7
CHARLIE,Leave me alone.,3
NURSE CASTOR,"Charlie, I want you to behave. Just relax.",8
CHARLIE,No! Don't do it! Don't do it!,7
NURSE CASTOR,Charlie...,1
CHARLIE,"No, Michael! Michael, don't!",4
CHARLIE,Mommy? I want to go home now.,7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Charlie? What are you doing up? Why are you dressed?,10
CHARLIE,They said I could go home now.,7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Who said that?,3
CHARLIE,The doctors. They said I could leave.,7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"All right, then. Let's just get your coat and we'll talk to the doctors.",14
CHARLIE,"No, Mommy. Let's just go home - now.",7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"OK, Charlie. We'll go straight home.",6
MULDER,What are you looking at?,5
SCULLY,Is that Mrs. Holvey?,4
MULDER,Where?,1
SCULLY,There. I think she's got Charlie with her.,8
NURSE CASTOR,Uhhh...,1
SCULLY,Nurse!,1
MULDER,Are you all right?,4
NURSE CASTOR,He hit me.,3
SCULLY,Who? Charlie?,2
NURSE CASTOR,"No... not him, the other one. There were two of them, two boys.",13
MULDER,You gotta get to Mrs. Holvey's house.,7
SCULLY,Why?,1
MULDER,That boy you saw leaving with Mrs. Holvey - that wasn't Charlie.,11
SCULLY,You're saying Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost?,9
MULDER,"A spirit, a ghost - I'm not sure but it's what we saw in the photograph. It's what the old woman was trying to protect the family from.",27
SCULLY,"But, Mulder...",2
MULDER,"Whatever it is, it's killed three people, and you've got to get to Mrs. Holvey's before it happens again.",19
SCULLY,What are you gonna do?,5
MULDER,Get help.,2
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"There you go, Charlie.",4
MICHAEL,Aren't you going to have some?,6
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"No, dear. I'm not hungry.",5
MICHAEL,Tomorrow we can go to the park.,7
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Yes. Sure.,2
MICHAEL,Can I have a balloon?,5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Uh-huh.,1
MICHAEL,"Can we ride the train, Mommy?",6
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Now you finish up and mommy will be right back, OK?",11
MAGGIE HOLVEY,nan,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,"Please, God. Don't let it be true.",7
MICHAEL,"What are you doing, Mommy?",5
MAGGIE HOLVEY,nan,1
MICHAEL,Mommy?,1
MAGGIE HOLVEY,nan,1
HEAD CALUSARI,Guard the door.,3
SCULLY,Mrs. Holvey?,2
SCULLY,Hello?,1
CHARLIE,"Fie newt, avet a plaratariat. New potex... new potex... new potex. Suffragettes agitaball. Pulley tot allso puritay from freeditay. Suffragette a agitaball. Ohh saaa... pu chette... agitaball... boy gotz.",29
HEAD CALUSARI,Come. Hold him down.,4
HEAD CALUSARI,"Don't look at him. Look away, or it will recognize you.",11
SCULLY,Charlie?,1
CHARLIE'S VOICE COMING FROM MAGGIE,Mommy?,1
CHARLIE,It hurts!,2
HEAD CALUSARI,Do not let go. He tricks you.,7
SCULLY,Are you all right?,4
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Charlie?,1
HEAD CALUSARI,Let the boy rest. We must find the mother. The boy needs her.,13
MULDER,"Scully, you all right?",4
SCULLY,We're OK. How's Charlie?,4
MAGGIE HOLVEY,Charlie! It's OK! Charlie!,4
HEAD CALUSARI,"It is over, for now. But you must be careful. It knows you.",13
MULDER,The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved...,22
MULDER,"... The boy, who will celebrate his tenth birthday next month, remains under the watchful care of his mother. And though I believe him innocent of the crimes, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.",50
