SKINNER,Kersh's office.,2
SCULLY,Who called them?,3

SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,Dana.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, my God.",3
MULDER,You okay?,2
SCULLY,"Am I okay? Mulder, I haven't seen you in such a long time.",13
SCULLY,I was so worried.,4
MULDER,"Well, it's okay, I'm all right. They're treating me really well in here.",13
SCULLY,What's happened to you?,4
MULDER,Nothing. I'm squared away.,4
MULDER,"Oh, hey, Walter. It's good to see you, man.",9
SKINNER,"Have they told you what the charges are, Mulder? What you're doing here?",13
MULDER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. We're clear on that.",7
SCULLY,You're clear on what?,4
MULDER,My crimes.,2
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"I murdered a man, Dana. I went looking for something that didn't exist, and I... I made a terrible mistake. I should be punished severely.",25
SKINNER,Whatever you were doing you have the right to a lawyer... to an inquiry and process of law.,18
MULDER,I don't think you heard me.,6
GUARD,All right - time's up.,4
SCULLY,We're going to get you out of here.,8
MULDER,And why is that? I'm a guilty man.,8
GUARD,Time's up. Let's go.,4
MULDER,Uh... excuse me.,3
MULDER,I don't understand. Why are you helping me?,8
KRYCEK,Because you can't do this alone.,6
GUARD,Let's go.,2
MULDER,You saw him? Mulder?,4
REYES,They've accused him of murder?,5
SCULLY,And they have him believing that he did it.,9
DOGGETT,Murdered who?,2
SCULLY,Knowle Rohrer.,2
DOGGETT,Knowle Rohrer? It can't be. I watched Knowle Rohrer die.,10
REYES,He can't die. Knowle Rohrer's a super soldier.,8
SKINNER,"Mulder side-stepped security at a facility known as Mount Weather -- a place where they say our so-called ""shadow government"" is installed.",21
REYES,What about this murder charge?,5
SKINNER,Thirty government workers are ready to testify they witnessed Mulder push a military officer to his death.,17
DOGGETT,Killing the man who can't be killed?,7
DOGGETT,Where are you going?,4
SCULLY,To beg mercy with the man upstairs.,7
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,Come in.,2
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"Deputy Director Kersh. I've just been going over my notes on this whole business. Please, have a seat.",18
KERSH,Thank you.,2
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"We both got a problem with this man of yours, Agent Mulder.",12
KERSH,Mulder's been a running problem for the FBI. But nothing this serious.,12
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,I would think...,3
KERSH,I've been asked by a female agent... Mulder's closest associate to beg mercy of the military court to give Mulder every consideration based on his good character.,27
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"You've reviewed the charges, yes?",5
KERSH,Yes. There's a charge of murder.,6
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,This would look bad for the Marines if it didn't look worse for the FBI. What does Mulder intend to plea?,21
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"You wanted a chance to clear up this mess, Mr. Kersh and I'm going to give it to you. Give it to the FBI.",24
KERSH,How?,1
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"A fair hearing for your agent by his own agency. Your prosecutor, your judges. Held in my court.",18
KERSH,That can't be legal. Why do this?,7
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,I want a verdict. A guilty verdict. This man Mulder has made a lot of enemies. He's a crusader. And a lot of people do not like the crusade.,29
KERSH,I can't do that.,4
GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG,"Oh, you'll do it, Deputy Director. You and I both know there are forces inside the government now that a man would be foolish to disobey.",26
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
MULDER,"I smelled you coming, Clarice.",5
SCULLY,"Oh, my...",2
SCULLY,"Damn it, Mulder. It's not funny to see you putting on that act.",13
MULDER,"No, that is funny.",4
MULDER,What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on that act.,18
MULDER,"Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man.",7
SKINNER,"The only thing you're going to be kissing, Mulder, is your sweet ass good-bye, with the trouble your in.",19
MULDER,"Uh-huh, I kind of gathered that right around the 50th brainwashing session.",12
SCULLY,"Mulder, why are they doing this to you?",8
MULDER,They think that they're preparing me for my trial. For my testimony.,12
SKINNER,Your testimony's not going to matter. Not with the case they're building.,12
MULDER,Not building. Rigging.,3
SKINNER,"Yeah, I don't think you understand the seriousness of the charges. This isn't some routine wrist slapping. You're on trial for your life.",23
MULDER,My trial's a forgone conclusion. What they really want is for me to admit my guilt and help them out. What's really on trial here is the truth.,28
SCULLY,"Mulder, they're saying you killed a man.",7
MULDER,Have they produced a body?,5
MULDER,You can't produce a body because you can't kill a man who won't die.,14
SKINNER,"Well, body or not, they've got 30 witnesses from that government facility ready to testify against you.",17
SCULLY,"Mulder, we'll get you the best lawyer.",7
MULDER,Would you defend a man who believes in aliens against the FBI and the military? It's never going to happen. Skinner can defend me.,24
SKINNER,I can't represent you.,4
MULDER,"You know all the facts, the details the whole government conspiracy. More than that, I trust you.",17
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,They can't try me without exposing themselves. I know what I'm doing.,12
MULDER,"Whooo, now it's a party.",5
DOGGETT,Agent Mulder.,2
SCULLY,What's the matter?,3
REYES,We've been working off what little we have but the military just got back to us.,16
DOGGETT,"You ready for this? I know this is impossible, but they're saying they got Knowle Rohrer's body.",17
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's me.",3
MULDER,Is it time to go?,5
SCULLY,No. That's why I'm here.,5
SCULLY,"Mulder, I need you to talk to me. Confide in me... or we'll lose.",14
MULDER,"We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting.",12
SCULLY,"You're scaring me. Mulder, I'm so scared that I've just got you back and now I'm going to lose you again.",21
MULDER,I know what I'm doing.,5
SCULLY,Well... whatever you're doing... you have no idea how much has already been lost... What I've had to do...,19
MULDER,I do know. Skinner told me.,6
SCULLY,"Our son, Mulder... I gave him up.",7
SCULLY,Our son. I'm so afraid you could never forgive me.,10
MULDER,I know you had no choice. I just missed both of you so much.,14
SCULLY,"God, where have you been? Where have you been hiding?",10
MULDER,In New Mexico.,3
SCULLY,Doing what?,2
MULDER,Looking for The Truth.,4
SCULLY,"You found something, didn't you? Huh?",6
SCULLY,What did you find?,4
MULDER,I can't tell you.,4
SCULLY,"You found something in that facility? That's what you were doing, right? Mulder, what did you find out there?",19
MULDER,"Scully, I can't tell you.",5
SCULLY,That doesn't make sense.,4
MULDER,"You've got to trust me, Scully. I know things. It's better you don't.",13
KALLENBRUNNER,Assistant Director Skinner.,3
KALLENBRUNNER,Special Agent Kallenbrunner. I'll be handling the prosecution. I'm out of the L.A. Field office.,15
SKINNER,How did you get this assignment?,6
KALLENBRUNNER,I was a Federal Prosecutor in D.C. Before joining the FBI. And you?,13
SKINNER,That's a good question.,4
KERSH,Let's bring in the defendant. This proceeding is called to order.,11
KERSH,Mr. Kallenbrunner you may proceed.,5
KALLENBRUNNER,"I have no witnesses to call. I will submit to the court, however the sworn testimony of 30 men and women who saw the crime.",25
KERSH,Assistant Director.,2
SKINNER,I move to dismiss these proceedings on the grounds it violates the accused's rights to a fair trail. I'm not a lawyer. You're not a judge. This is not a court of law.,33
KERSH,This is a military court of law. You may want to familiarize yourself with title ten of the U.S. Code. But I suggest you call a witness.,27
SKINNER,"Then I move to delay this trial. My central witness, Marita Covarrubias works for the united nations and I can't locate her. And I've received no help from the U.S. Government locating her.",33
KERSH,"I have to deny that request. Do you another witness, Mr. Skinner?",12
SKINNER,I'll call a witness but I would like to do so under protest.,13
KERSH,"Both the panel's judgments and rulings are sovereign, Mr. Skinner. There is no record.",14
SKINNER,"Excuse me? This isn't a secret tribunal. As you've so kindly informed me, it's a court of law.",18
KERSH,"Military court of law, Mr. Skinner",6
MULDER,It's okay. Try your case.,5
SKINNER,Please state your name for the court.,7
SCULLY,My name is Dana Katherine Scully. I was assigned nine years ago to the X-Files to spy on Agent Mulder whose methods the FBI distrusted.,25
SKINNER,"Assigned not just as an agent, but as a medical doctor. A scientist. And as a serious scientist you came to believe in Agent Mulder's theories. cryogenic container.",28
SCULLY,I came to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life and in a conspiracy inside the government to keep their existence a secret.,23
SKINNER,The proof was overwhelming. It was even scientifically undeniable.,9
SCULLY,I believe as do many respected scientists that life came to earth millions of years ago from a meteor or a rock from Mars.,24
SKINNER,"So, what you're saying is, life-- human life-- is extraterrestrial by definition.",12
KALLENBRUNNER,Objection. What does this nonsense have to do with Mulder murdering a man in cold blood?,16
SKINNER,Agent Scully will prove that a government conspiracy exists to deny the existence of extra-terrestrials.,15
KERSH,You are not here proving government conspiracies Mr. Skinner. You are here to defend Fox Mulder.,16
SKINNER,And I'm trying to do that.,6
KERSH,"It's your case, Mr. Skinner.",5
SKINNER,"So, a meteor crashed to earth but along with the biological building blocks on it there was something else -- an alien virus.",22
SCULLY,I believe there was a virus which thrived here prehistorically. I believe that virus infected early man and transformed his physiology.,21
SKINNER,Changed him into something else.,5
SCULLY,Into an alien life-form himself.,5
SKINNER,And what happened to these aliens?,6
SCULLY,"They died in the last ice age, 35,000 years ago.",10
SKINNER,And the virus?,3
SCULLY,It lay dormant underground until it surfaced once again during our current geologic period.,14

SKINNER,A UFO crash revealed a virus? making it out of harm's way.,12
SCULLY,The virus thrived underground in petroleum deposits. In black oil. It has sentience. It can think. It has the ability to communicate and it communicated with the UFOs.,28
SKINNER,"And the government knows this, too. next to each other looking at something hooked up to life support through a window. a door. support.]",24
SCULLY,"In Roswell, they captured aliens from the spacecraft wreckage. They salvaged various alien technology from them and from their data banks they learned of the alien plan to ""re-colonize"" the earth.",31
KERSH,Is this all leading anywhere?,5
MULDER,Yeah. The destruction of mankind.,5
KERSH,"I'll warn you once, Agent Mulder.",6
SKINNER,And what did the government do with this... information of an alien takeover?,13
SCULLY,They kept it a dark secret. If it had gotten out there would have been wild panic.,17
KERSH,"Mr. Skinner, are we finished?",5
SKINNER,No. There's the matter of Agent Scully's own abduction in 1994.,11
KERSH,Abduction by whom? * Light moving fast across the sky something. Scully's abdomen filling up. rising and expanding. coloured liquid and with bodies within them. glass on the tank with his hand to see clearer the fully grown clone within.],39
SCULLY,By the military working with the government conspirators to develop a breed of human-alien hybrids that the aliens would use as a slave race.,24
SKINNER,"Thank you, Agent Scully. Your witness, Mr. Kallenbrunner.",8
KALLENBRUNNER,All these ET'S running around... it's hard to keep these aliens straight without a scorecard. I myself have never seen an alien. Could we call one as a witness?,29
SCULLY,You're being facetious.,3
KALLENBRUNNER,"No, I'm not. I'd like to see some proof.",9
SCULLY,There are the mars rocks...,5
KALLENBRUNNER,No. I need something good. Something amazing. Something really cool.,10
SCULLY,I don't know what you mean.,6
KALLENBRUNNER,"Well, what I mean is, you have no proof to back up one word you just told us. Agent Scully, isn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers, and you got pregnant and had his love child?",38
SKINNER,Objection!,1
KALLENBRUNNER,Thank you. Next witness.,4
SKINNER,Can you state your full name?,6
JEFFREY SPENDER,Jeffrey Frank Spender.,3
SKINNER,"Mr. Spender, I know you didn't hear Mr. Kallenbrunner, but he'd like to make a mockery of the X-Files. You worked on the X-Files yourself.",25
JEFFREY SPENDER,"Yes, until three years ago.",5
SKINNER,When you were shot in the X-Files office. Shot by your father. gun firing ],14
SKINNER,Can I ask you to please tell the court exactly who your father was?,14
JEFFREY SPENDER,He led the government conspiracy to exploit the existence of aliens.,11
KALLENBRUNNER,Objection. There's no government conspiracy that I've seen established here.,10
KERSH,I agree with Mr. Kallenbrunner. I don't see where this is going.,12
SKINNER,"If I can prove this conspiracy, it will justify Mulder's actions and you will have no choice but to acquit.",20
KERSH,"I hope this isn't the entire basis of your defence, Mr. Skinner.",12
SKINNER,"You have a relationship to Agent Mulder don't you, Mr. Spender? Rhode Island.",13

JEFFREY SPENDER,"He didn't know both his father and mine were in the alien conspiracy. His father was a reluctant member. When Agent Mulder began to know the truth about this connection, my father had his father killed by an assassin named Alex Krycek.",42
SKINNER,He killed him to silence him? Scully is standing next to Mulder. Mulder pulls off the file label to reveal,20

JEFFREY SPENDER,She was returned. She was sent to California where we were raised together. She was taken many more times and suffered horrible tests.,23

JEFFREY SPENDER,I believe my father is dead.,6
KALLENBRUNNER,"Mr. Spender, you're here to speak for the character of Agent Mulder. In reports you filed while an FBI agent I see here you describe Mulder as ""arrogant,"" ""difficult,"" ""a control freak widely disliked by his peers.""",37
JEFFREY SPENDER,Those reports were written before I knew the truth. Morleys in his hands.],13
KALLENBRUNNER,"This report calls him ""unstable prone to violent outbursts."" I have the report right here if your memory needs refreshing.",20
KALLENBRUNNER,"Thank you, Mr. Spender.",4
GIBSON PRAISE,You found out about Mulder. You found out he's in trouble. I'll get ready now.,15
MULDER,I know what you want and I can't give it to you.,12
SCULLY,"Make them a deal, Mulder. Guilty on a lesser charge. Maybe they'll go for it and they'll let you walk out of here.",23
MULDER,"I'd rather die, Scully.",4
SCULLY,"How can you say that? How can you say that, Mulder, to me?",13
MULDER,Because this is greater than you or me. This is about everything we worked for for nine years. The truth that we both sacrificed so much to uncover and to expose.,31
SCULLY,"Well, then, expose it, Mulder! Take the stand. Whatever it is that you're withholding take the stand and hit them full force.",22
MULDER,I can't.,2
SCULLY,Why?,1
MULDER,I just can't.,3
SCULLY,"You say this is greater than us, and maybe it is, but this is us fighting this fight, Mulder, not you. It's you and me. That's what I'm fighting for, Mulder. You and me.",34
X,Get up.,2
MULDER,Who's that? Who's there?,4
MULDER,What are you doing here?,5
X,That's what I'm here to ask you.,7
MULDER,I'm putting the truth on trial.,6
X,What truth? Who's truth? You think these men will even hear it?,12
MULDER,They're afraid to hear it.,5
X,"They're not afraid. They have too much power to be afraid. You're going to learn that, just like I did. You'll die learning it.",24
MULDER,I'm not afraid of that.,5
X,There's a truth even you're afraid to speak now because you know it's futile.,14
MULDER,No. Because I refuse to accept it.,7
X,Then you're going to need help.,6
MULDER,How can you possibly help me?,6
DOGGETT,"They said this is where I could find the body, at Fort Marlene.",13

SKINNER,A position giving you unrestricted access to countries and leaders around the world. Isn't that right?,16
MARITA,Yes.,1
SKINNER,How did you use this power?,6
MARITA,"Basically, to further the interests of a secretive group of men who called themselves The Syndicate.",16
SKINNER,What were their interests?,4
MARITA,Developing an alien virus vaccine before the Russians developed one.,10
SKINNER,And how'd they go about that? down on a table strapped in place under chicken wire.],16

MARITA,Mostly. Some developed suspicions. I saw Russians who cut off their arms to prevent being tracked.,16
SKINNER,As they did to an American man that you worked quite intimately with.,13
MARITA,Yes. Alex Krycek.,3
SKINNER,Did you believe in the syndicate? In their international conspiracy?,10
MARITA,No. I was paid for my access.,7
SKINNER,"In fact, you came to hate them.",7
MARITA,Yes. It's why I helped Agent Mulder when he approached me.,11

MARITA,They turned me into a...,5
MARITA,... a test subject.,3
SKINNER,Testing what?,2
MARITA,"They were pretending to work with the aliens to infect the entire population with an alien virus, but the conspirators were trying to save themselves by secretly and selfishly developing a vaccine. The conspirators believed all life in the universe had been infected with the virus including a race of shape-shifting alien bounty hunters who policed the conspiracy for the aliens. But they were wrong and it led to the destruction of the conspiracy.",74
SKINNER,And who destroyed it? running from them. Close up of a Rebel with his eyes and mouth sewn shut.],19
MARITA,A group of renegade aliens who had avoided infection with the virus through self-disfigurement.,14
SKINNER,And the conspirators themselves -- what happened to them? surrounded by the faceless rebels.],13
MARITA,They're all dead now. Killed by these same faceless aliens.,10
SKINNER,Then what are you afraid of now?,7
SKINNER,Why resist testifying here today?,5
SKINNER,Because the conspiracy continues just in another form by other men.,11
KALLENBRUNNER,Objection. Mr. Skinner can't ask questions and give the answers.,10
KERSH,Sustained.,1
SKINNER,"Fox Mulder's on trial for murder here. The man he's accused of killing is one of these new conspirators. An alien replacement for a human being. What they're calling a super soldier. You can prove this, can't you?",38
SKINNER,"You know who these men are, don't you? Ms. Covarrubias?",10
KRYCEK,They'll kill her.,3
SKINNER,"Ms. Covarrubias, I asked you a question. I need an answer.",11
MULDER,No.,1
MULDER,It's okay. Let her go.,5
SKINNER,"What the hell are you doing, Mulder? She's the last best witness that we have.",15
MULDER,Doesn't matter.,2
SKINNER,"Thank you, Ms. Covarrubias. I got nothing else.",8
DOGGETT,Assistant Director.,2
SKINNER,I have an unscheduled witness that I'd like to call here today.,12
MULDER,"No, not him.",3
SKINNER,"Mulder, sit down.",3
SKINNER,"Well, now he's here to protect you.",7
KERSH,Mr. Kallenbrunner? Do you have any objections to this witness?,10
KALLENBRUNNER,Not like Mr. Mulder here does.,6
SKINNER,Can you tell us your name?,6
GIBSON PRAISE,Gibson Andrew Praise.,3
SKINNER,Do you know this man?,5
GIBSON PRAISE,Yes. He's my friend. I hid him in the desert for the last year. of GIBSON moving the brown rook. a brace and his skull is open and his brain tissue exposed.],32
SKINNER,Mulder met you as a chess protégé. You're life was endangered because of your highly unusual brain activity.,18
KERSH,"Cut to the chase, Mr. Skinner.",6
SKINNER,"Gibson Praise can read people's minds. Mulder and Scully proved this scientifically. There's a certain ""junk DNA"" which all humans share but has no apparent function. Gibson's ""junk DNA"" is functional. DNA which is believed to be alien.",38
KALLENBRUNNER,You're trying to tell us this boy can read minds?,10
GIBSON,Yes.,1
MULDER,He's reading your mind right now.,6
KALLENBRUNNER,"And the minds of the judges, too?",7
GIBSON PRAISE,Yes.,1
GIBSON PRAISE,Even his.,2
KALLENBRUNNER,And what makes him so special?,6
GIBSON PRAISE,He's not human.,3
MULDER,He's one of them.,4
MULDER,One of them! I want that man examined!,8
KERSH,Mr. Skinner control him!,4
MULDER,You're afraid!,2
SKINNER,Mulder!,1
MULDER,Where's Gibson?,2
REYES,He's with Scully... in good hands.,6
DOGGETT,We spent the night talking to him. Gibson knows you're concerned. We're protecting him now.,15
MULDER,He shouldn't have done what he did -- exposing himself like that.,11
SKINNER,"Well, the boy was trying to protect you and it looks like it may have worked.",16
REYES,He says three judges are wavering. They're leaning in your favour.,11
MULDER,It's going to take a little more than that the way things are going. We were never going to win.,20
SKINNER,"Take the stand, Mulder. Testify.",5
MULDER,No.,1
DOGGETT,"Then we'll testify, me and Monica.",6
MULDER,No.,1
REYES,Both of us have seen too much...,7
MULDER,"Listen to me, they'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street.",13
DOGGETT,What's left for us on the X-Files?,7
REYES,We came to this job to give it our best. It's the way we're going to leave.,17
MULDER,It's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it.,14
DOGGETT,Then let's shove it up their ass.,7
KERSH,Mr. Skinner?,2
SKINNER,I'd like to call John Doggett.,6
SKINNER,"Agent Doggett... you've been on the X-Files for two years. And with all that you've seen how do you feel about this term ""paranormal""?",24
DOGGETT,"Well, the way I look at it, calling something paranormal is just a way of avoiding a real explanation.",19
SKINNER,"You're a sceptic. But I see here in your own case reports some very detailed descriptions of things that a sceptic would never believe in... these so called ""Super-Soldiers.""",29
DOGGETT,"Well, that's a whole different deal.",6
SKINNER,In what way? hit at point blank range and continuing to advance. into the garbage truck. MULDER and SKINNER leaning over the side of the roof to see BILLY MILES being squashed into something the size of a box.,39
DOGGETT,'Cause I've seen it with my own eyes; shot... drowned... even ground up in a garbage truck. And they just come right back to life.,25
SKINNER,What are they?,3
DOGGETT,"Well, the best I can figure they're some kind of secret military project-ordinary men made invincible.",16
KALLENBRUNNER,Objection. What does this science fiction have to do with anything?,11
SKINNER,Agent Doggett is going to tell you that the man that Mulder is accused of killing is a super soldier. A man that Agent Doggett served with in the marines. Name of Knowle Rohrer.,34
KALLENBRUNNER,Objection. Agent Doggett was not present at the murder nor has he seen or examined the victim.,17
DOGGETT,That's because I've been getting the bum's rush from the government.,11
KERSH,Objection sustained.,2
SKINNER,"Well, then, let me ask you, Agent Doggett if a super soldier is invincible, how could Mulder have killed this man?",21
DOGGETT,He couldn't. face begins to turn black with oxidation from the metal within him. SCULLY holding her gun on SHADOWMAN and not moving. A look of surprise on her face at what's happening in front of her. SHADOWMAN flying past SCULLY and smashing into the quarry walls.],47
DOGGETT,The way I understand it they only way to kill a super soldier is with some rare metal. Agent Scully says it's a form of magnetite from some meteor that fell to earth.,33
SKINNER,"And Mulder's not accused of doing that, is he?",9
DOGGETT,"No, sir.",2
SKINNER,Your witness.,2
KALLENBRUNNER,"Agent Doggett... in going over your files I must say... it's an honor to speak to a man whose record is distinguished by such duty to his country. Now, I'm not going to doubt a man of your integrity, Agent Doggett, even if he tells me a story I find too incredible to believe.",54
DOGGETT,Thank you.,2
KALLENBRUNNER,Just as you must not doubt the integrity of Fox Mulder on whose behalf you're here to testify.,18
DOGGETT,Correct.,1
KALLENBRUNNER,Even if Mulder believes these so-called super soldiers are aliens?,10
KALLENBRUNNER,"He believes they're aliens, you know. You said you were a sceptic.",12
DOGGETT,That's right.,2
KALLENBRUNNER,"So an alien conspiracy which Mulder has built his defence on must be entirely unbelievable to you, too.",18
REYES,My name is Monica Reyes. I've been with the FBI since 1990.,12
SKINNER,"Before coming onto the X-Files, Agent Reyes, you worked in the New Orleans field office investigating cases of satanic ritual abuse.",21
REYES,I did.,2
SKINNER,Did you ever prosecute any of these satanic cases?,9
REYES,No.,1
KALLENBRUNNER,"For god's sake, Mr. Skinner, we're trying a man for murder not taking a trip down memory lane.",18
SKINNER,I'm showing the court that Agent Reyes is level-headed and objective on strange and extraordinary cases. That her belief in aliens comes from firsthand experience. And she can offer you hard proof that there is an alien conspiracy!,38
REYES,I was called on last year to protect Agent Scully who was pregnant and whose life was in danger because of her pregnancy.,23
KALLENBRUNNER,What does this have to do with aliens? inside and they're using a flashlight to see by. side of the building wall and falls to the ground. BILLY MILES gets shot by a shotgun and falls backwards. labours and watch her give birth.],43
REYES,"I drove Agent Scully to a secluded location in Georgia where it was believed she could deliver safely. But we soon discovered we weren't alone. I was attacked and had to defend myself against an assailant, who was shot at point-blank range. Who should have died, but didn't. This assailant was then joined by others like him who surrounded Agent Scully and me, and witnessed her as she gave birth to her son.",73
KALLENBRUNNER,Witnessed her? What do you mean?,6
REYES,"We were confused as well. But we came to understand that her son was a kind of miracle child. Its birth was all important to these people; these so- called Super-Soldiers, who I believe are humans replaced by aliens.",39
KALLENBRUNNER,"Why would Scully's child be important to aliens, Agent Reyes? death of her husband. She then leaves SCULLY. REYES is standing on the side. searches through the names looking for either her own and/or her son's.]",36
REYES,We came to learn that Scully was one of a number of random women who had miraculous childbirths and these women all had been abducted as part of a government program to secretly manipulate their biology operating offshore on a navy ship using these women as surrogates.,47
KALLENBRUNNER,Surrogates?,1
REYES,For alien babies.,3
KALLENBRUNNER,To create a slave race.,5
REYES,Yes.,1
KALLENBRUNNER,"A program conducted by the Navy, on a ship which is where? narrowly escaping the bomb's detonation.]",17
REYES,The ship housing this program was exploded on the Baltimore dock.,11
KALLENBRUNNER,"So, in other words, we have no true evidence past your good word.",13
KALLENBRUNNER,"You claim Scully gave birth to one of these alien babies. How can you be sure of this, Agent Reyes? taken from AGENT COMER flies through the air, out of the room and directly toward WILLIAM who is lying in his crib. The piece of metal breaks through the wooden frame and stop in front of WILLIAM. SCULLY and REYES run into the room to see the metal piece leisurely floating and slowly turning above the baby.]",77
REYES,I saw her child do things that could be explained no other way. I saw him display amazing powers. He'd move objects with his mind.,25
KALLENBRUNNER,Really? Do you think we could arrange a demonstration for the court? That we could see that ourselves?,18
REYES,No. The child was given up for adoption to an anonymous family.,12
KALLENBRUNNER,She gave up the miracle child? The proof of everything that she and Mulder claim that they've risked their lives for over the last nine years - she just sent it off to some strangers?,34
REYES,"Yes, to protect him!",4
KALLENBRUNNER,"Thank you, Agent Reyes. That's all.",6
REYES,You don't care about that child or what Scully had to sacrifice. You're only too happy she had to give it up so there's no proof.,26
KERSH,Agent Reyes.,2
REYES,"You don't care what these people have sacrificed over the last nine years - what's been lost to their cause. You make a mockery of it, gladdened it proves your point.",30
KERSH,"Agent Reyes, that's enough!",4
REYES,"What is the point of all of this? To destroy a man who seeks the truth or to destroy the truth so no man can seek it? Either way, you lose.",31
DOGGETT,Are you ready for this? We may have found Knowle Rohrer.,11
SCULLY,You found him?,3
REYES,His body.,2
SCULLY,What are you talking about? There can't be a body; he can't die. Knowle Rohrer is a super soldier.,19
REYES,Exactly. But they're saying it's him -- the man Mulder killed.,10
SCULLY,Who's saying it's him?,4
DOGGETT,I got some guy on the phone at Fort Marlene who didn't know that he was supposed to give me the run-around. I got him to send the victim's corpse to Quantico.,32
SCULLY,It's there now?,3
REYES,We got a car out front.,6
REYES,Agent Doggett can stay with him.,6
REYES,"Oh, my god. This is Knowle Rohrer?",7
SCULLY,That's what it says here.,5
REYES,"Well, how could anyone tell if it wasn't?",8
SCULLY,I need you to get me Knowle Rohrer's medical records.,10
REYES,They'd have to come from the military. I don't know if I can.,13
SCULLY,"You've got to, Monica; whatever it takes. I need those records for Skinner. I need them for Mulder.",18
KERSH,Mr. Skinner. Please call your next witness.,7
SCULLY,Assistant Director...,2
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,What's going to get you off.,6
SKINNER,"I want to move to dismiss again based on new evidence I just received that there is no victim. That the body of Knowle Rohrer is not Knowle Rohrer, but that of a man who died of a broken neck and whose body was burned post-mortem.",46
KERSH,Motion denied.,2
SCULLY,You can't deny it.,4
KERSH,"You're out of order and in contempt of court, Agent Scully.",11
SCULLY,You're in contempt. I have evidence proving that Agent Mulder is innocent.,12
KERSH,"You have no authorization to examine the body, Agent Scully. Have her removed from the courtroom.",16
MULDER,"If she's got evidence, you got to listen.",8
KERSH,Order! Remove the defendant from the courtroom. This trial is adjourned.,11
FADE IN TO,nan,1
FADE OUT,nan,1
FADE IN TO,nan,1
KERSH,Gentlemen... we have a verdict. If you'd rise.,8
KERSH,"Acting fairly and impartially, this panel finds the defendant... guilty of first degree murder under aggravated circumstances. Is there anything you'd like to say on your behalf, Mr. Mulder... before we decide your sentence?",34
MULDER,Yes.,1
MULDER,"I'd like to congratulate you on succeeding where so many before you have failed. A bullet between the eyes would have been preferable to this charade. But I've learned to pretend over the past nine years - to pretend that my victories mattered only to realize that no one was keeping score. To realize that liars do not fear the truth if there are enough liars. That the devil is just one man with a plan but evil, true evil, is a collaboration of men which is what we have here today. If I am a guilty man, my crime is in daring to believe that the truth will out and that no one lie can live forever. I believe it still. Much as you try to bury it, the truth is out there. Greater than your lies, the truth wants to be known. You will know it. It'll come to you, as it's come to me faster than the speed of light.",162
MULDER,You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now and maybe you are .. but you're only done it by cutting off your own heads.,24
SCULLY,Who was it?,3
SCULLY,Agent Doggett?,2
DOGGETT,Death by lethal injection.,4
POST GUARD,"Evening. ID, please.",3
POST GUARD,Master Sergeant Rohrer? Go on ahead.,6
DOGGETT,Get up.,2
MULDER,Who's there?,2
DOGGETT,I'm here with Skinner. Get up.,6
SKINNER,"Move it, Mulder.",3
MULDER,What are you doing?,4
DOGGETT,We're getting you out of here. Come on.,8
ROHRER,Guard!,1
ROHRER,Where is he?,3
ROHRER,Seal the building.,3
ROHRER,Seal the base.,3
KERSH,You're never going to make it this way.,8
KERSH,Come on.,2
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
KERSH,You've got to move out.,5
SCULLY,What's he doing?,3
KERSH,What I should have done from the start.,8
KERSH,"You want to go north to Canada. Get to an airport. If you're not off the continent in 24 hours you may never get out, you understand? DOGGETT and REYES.)",30
MULDER,None of you will be safe now.,7
DOGGETT,You let us worry about that.,6
REYES,Good luck.,2
SCULLY,"Mulder, Kersh told us to head north. You just got on a road going south.",15
MULDER,That's right.,2
SCULLY,Where are you going?,4
MULDER,To see a man about The Truth.,7
FADE INTO,nan,1
GIBSON PRAISE,You can't hide me forever.,5
REYES,We can destroy your files - make it next to impossible to find you.,13
GIBSON PRIASE,You don't know these people.,5
DOGGETT,"I'm going to protect you, Gibson.",6
REYES,John...,1
DOGGETT,What the hell is this? What the hell is going on?,11
DOGGETT,They can't do this. Who authorized this?,7
REYES,I'm going to find out.,5
REYES,They've packed up The X-Files.,5
SKINNER,I know. It's out of control. I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. I'm trying to get to Kersh.,21
SKINNER,All I can think is it's punishment for taking Mulder's side. Unless they found out that we helped him escape.,20
DOGGETT,"Then they know about the Deputy Director's involvement, too.",9
SKINNER,I need to see the Deputy Director.,7
TOOTHPICK MAN,And he needs to see you.,6
GIBSON PRAISE,He knows. we're all in danger here.,7
GIBSON PRAISE,No. He knows about Mulder and Scully -- where they're going.,10
REYES,You mean the border?,4
GIBSON PRAISE,"No, that's not where they went and they know that. They're going to find them and kill them.",18
DOGGETT,"Where are they, Gibson? Mulder and Scully -- where'd they go?",10
FROHIKE,"Hey, hot shot! You might have the common courtesy of doing your business there downwind.",15
MULDER,"Oh, boy.",2
LANGLY,Why don't you just finish draining the little lizard and then we'll talk?,13
BYERS,We're very worried about you.,5
FROHIKE,"It's craziness, man. Turn around.",5
LANGLEY,Just hang a big U-ie and never look back.,9
MULDER,I can't.,2
BYERS,"Why risk perfect happiness, Mulder? Why risk your lives?",9
MULDER,Because I need to know the truth.,7
BYERS,You already know the truth.,5
MULDER,I need to know if I can change it.,9
LANGLY,Change it?,2
FROHIKE,For crying out loud. All you're going to do is get yourself killed.,13
SCULLY,Mulder! What are you doing?,5
MULDER,"I'll be right with you, Scully.",6
SCULLY,What are they?,3
MULDER,"Pueblos. Anasazi Indian. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows why.",10
SCULLY,"Yeah, Mulder, but what are we doing here?",8
MULDER,Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me?,10
SCULLY,"Mulder, what is it?",4
MULDER,I was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount Keeper of the Truth.,18
REYES,Do you see anything at all?,6
CSM,"What's the matter, Agent Mulder?",5
CSM,You come to see the wise man but you look as if you've seen a ghost.,16
MULDER,You're no wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X.,13
CSM,"You see a dead man, Agent Scully?",7
SCULLY,"I hoped and prayed you were dead you chain-smoking, son of a bitch.",13
CSM,You waste your time. Ask Mulder. He knows the futility of hopes and prayers. He knows the truth now.,19
CSM,"You have told her the truth haven't you, Fox? I helped you find it.",14
MULDER,You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing exactly what I'd find.,16
CSM,"And now you refuse to speak it. Not to Scully, not to anyone. You've even refused to testify what you learned... even though it would have saved your life. You damned me for my secrets... but you're afraid to speak the truth.",42
MULDER,You call me afraid? Look at you sitting here alone in the dark like a fossil.,16
CSM,It's the final refuge. The last place to hide from those who are insidiously taking power now.,17
SCULLY,Who?,1
CSM,"The aliens. They fear this place... its geology. Magnetite. Like that which brought down the original UFO in Roswell. Indian wise men realized this over 2,000 years ago. They hid here and watched their own culture die. The Original Shadow Government.",41
REYES,Agent Doggett!,2
DOGGETT,Who the hell's that?,4
CSM,"It leaves me to tell you what Mulder's afraid to, Agent Scully.",12
MULDER,"Come on, let's go.",4
CSM,It's a scary story. You want to come sit on my lap?,12
SCULLY,You don't scare me.,4
CSM,My story's scared every president since Truman in '47.,9
MULDER,You don't have to hear this.,6
SCULLY,"No, I want to hear it, Mulder.",7
CSM,"Ten centuries ago the Mayans were so afraid that their calendar stopped on the exact date that my story begins. December 22, the year 2012. The date of the final alien invasion. Mulder can confirm the date. He saw it at Mount Weather......where our own ""Secret Government"" will be hiding when it all comes down.",55
MULDER,"Yeah, you smile... feeling drunk with power. The power to do nothing.",12
CSM,"My power comes from telling you. Seeing your powerlessness hearing it. They wanted to kill you, Fox. I protected you all these years... waiting for this moment... to see you broken. Afraid.",32
CSM,Now you can die.,4
CUT BACK TO,nan,1
DOGGETT,"Run, Monica. Get out of here.",6
REYES,No.,1
ROHRER,"Shoot me, Agent Doggett, if you think it'll make a difference this time.",13
MULDER,Agent Doggett!,2
DOGGETT,"Mulder, get out of there!",5
REYES,They know where you are!,5
CUT BACK TO,nan,1
MULDER,Get out of here!,4
DOGGETT,Get in the car.,4
MULDER,No!,1
MULDER,Go! Go!,2
CUT BACK TO,nan,1
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,I'm thinking... I'm a guilty man. I've failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest punishment for my crimes.,19
SCULLY,You don't believe that.,4
MULDER,"I believe that I sat in a motel room like this with you when we first met and I tried to convince you of the truth. And in that respect, I succeeded, but... in every other way...",37
MULDER,... I've failed.,2
SCULLY,"You don't believe that, either.",5
MULDER,Mmmm.,1
MULDER,I've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the man - the date's set. I can't change that.,20
SCULLY,You wouldn't tell me. Not because you were afraid or broken.... but because you didn't want to accept defeat.,19
MULDER,"Well, I was afraid of what knowing would do to you.",11
MULDER,I was afraid that it would crush your spirit.,9
SCULLY,"Why would I accept defeat? Why would I accept it, if you won't? Mulder, you say that you've failed but you only fail if you give up. And I know you -- you can't give up. It's what I saw in you when we first met. It's what made me follow you... why I'd do it all over again.",58
MULDER,And look what it's gotten you.,6
SCULLY,"And what has it gotten you? Not your sister. Nothing that you've set out for. But you won't give up, even now.",22
SCULLY,You've always said that you want to believe. But believe in what Mulder? If this is the truth that you've been looking for then what is left to believe in?,30
MULDER,"I want to believe that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us - greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves.",57
SCULLY,Then we believe the same thing.,6
MULDER,Maybe there's hope. THE TRUTH REALLY IS OUT THERE...,9
