MULDER'S ANSWERING MACHINE,"Hi, this is Fox Mulder. You can leave me a message after the beep. call me on my cell phone. I think you know the number.""",26
ARTHUR DALES,"Agent Mulder, this is Arthur Dales to get this crappy connection.] I don't know if you're watching the news but we're in for a hell of a blow in the next 12 to 24. I been through hurricanes, Mulder, been through the alphabet. But I just got a distress call from my neighbor down the road to set my teeth on edge. You don't have much time to get to the airport but if you're the X-Files man you say you are you better get your butt in gear.",89
RADIO ANNOUNCER,"... a spokesman for the Collier County Emergency Response Team is advising residents to stay off the roads and either wait out the storm in a secure location or proceed to a county emergency shelter. Hurricane Leroy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast sending high winds and up to six inches of rain onto coastal communities. As of yet, it has unleashed none of its potential heavy destruction on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers. The National Weather Service predicts Hurricane Leroy will make landfall in the next three to four hours, and we'll be coming back to you in a few minutes...",107
MAN 1,"We got no sign of anything amiss here at that residence out on the spit. Place is all boarded up tight, over.",22
MAN 2,"Roger that. Maybe the occupants have evacuated, over.",8
MAN 1,"Well, that would be the Shipleys, but a neighbor called and says they couldn't have gone too far without their only vehicle which is still in the carport out here, over.",31
MAN 2,"Well. That sounds like a real mystery, don't it?",9
ARTHUR DALES,"It sure does, you dumb fathead.",6
ARTHUR DALES,"Well, it couldn't be that all the planes out were fully loaded, huh?",13
MULDER,"Mr. Dales, there's a reason that people don't head out into hurricanes.",12
ARTHUR DALES,Yeah. The hurricane's 20 miles offshore.,6
MULDER,"Mr. Dales, can we come in?",6
ARTHUR DALES,Come in.,2
ARTHUR DALES,Who's this?,2
SCULLY,Special Agent Dana Scully.,4
ARTHUR DALES,Scully?,1
MULDER,She's my partner.,3
ARTHUR DALES,"Uh-huh. Well, don't get too comfortable. You're going to want to get right back out there.",16
SCULLY,Out where?,2
ARTHUR DALES,Did you tell her what I told you?,8
MULDER,"Yes, but she's... she's not the type that's easily persuaded.",10
ARTHUR DALES,Is that so?,3
SCULLY,What he means is I don't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it's the Lord's gospel truth.,21
ARTHUR DALES,Why did you bring her here?,6
MULDER,"Well, she knows your reputation your early work on the X-Files and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things.",23
SCULLY,"Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.",5
ARTHUR DALES,"It's a good thing I have a reputation. Otherwise, how could it be impugned?",14
SCULLY,"Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm. I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends.",27
ARTHUR DALES,"The Shipleys-- a young couple with a son. Yeah, he lives out on the end of the sandspit. Sara called me in a panic. She said that something in the house had grabbed Jack, her husband.",36
SCULLY,"In the bathroom, you said?",5
ARTHUR DALES,Yeah... of all places.,4
MULDER,It was your description that caused Agent Scully's... … dubiousness.,10
ARTHUR DALES,No. Not my description. No. That was … that was …. Sara's. She said... that it had tentacles wrapped around her husband's neck and choking him.,26
SCULLY,And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?,10
ARTHUR DALES,No. Both she and Jack are marine biologists. Or at least they were. I fear the worst.,17
MULDER,"She's missing, too?",3
ARTHUR DALES,Uh-huh. Yeah. I got on the horn to the local constabulary but they're about as... helpful as a fart in a windstorm.,22
ARTHUR DALES,I would have gone out there myself but for my bad hip.,12
MULDER,It's not a night that anybody should be out in.,10
ARTHUR DALES,"Well, I don't see that there's a choice.",8
ARTHUR DALES,If anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this...,11
SCULLY,"What is it that brought you out here in the first place, Mr. Dales?",14
ARTHUR DALES,"I came down for the weather. Don't sneer at the mysteries of the deep, young lady. The bottom of the ocean is as deep and dark as the imagination.",29
MULDER,Hello! Mrs. Shipley!,3
SCULLY,At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane.,19
MULDER,Got the place all boarded up. It's from the inside. It makes you wonder how they got out.,18
SCULLY,Hello! Mrs. Shipley!,3
SCULLY,Mulder... No sign of life.,5
MULDER,There's …something on the drainpipe. I can't get it off.,10
MULDER,I don't know if I'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here.,14
SCULLY,How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine?,11
MULDER,Maybe he was taking a dip... After he finished boarding up the windows.,13
SCULLY,Where do you think this leads to?,7
MULDER,Must be the bathroom. Dales told me the wife told him that the... the husband was grabbed from the bathroom.,20
SCULLY,Mr. Shipley!,2
MULDER,Can you give me a hand with this?,8
DEPUTY GREER,"Well, howdy do! Yeah. Right like that. Keep your hands up there where I can see them. Now who are you and what the hell do you think you're doing?",30
DEPUTY GREER,Yeah. Nice and slow.,4
MULDER,You can put the gun down. We're FBI.,8
DEPUTY GREER,Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.,8
SCULLY,"Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder. I can show you my ba -...",12
DEPUTY GREER,"This is Deputy Greer. I'm out at the Sandspit Road. I've got two suspects over at the Shipley residence. B and E, possible foul play, over.",26
MULDER,We're out here like you. We're...,6
DISPATCHER,"Copy that, 54. Be advised we have no backup units available.",11
DEPUTY GREER,Roger that. I'm putting you under arrest.,7
MULDER,"We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.",8
DEPUTY GREER,You have the right to remain silent.,7
MULDER,Arthur Dales called us.,4
DEPUTY GREER,Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have a right to a lawyer. If you don't have one...,22
MULDER,Does that name mean anything to you? Arthur Dales?,9
DEPUTY GREER,I know Dales.,3
MULDER,All right.,2
DEPUTY GREER,"I got a call from him, too. Drunk as a skunk. What's new?",13
SCULLY,"Well, what else would we be doing out here on a night like this?",14
DEPUTY GREER,"You could be looters. For all I know, you could be part of the Manson family.",16
DEPUTY GREER,"Oh, no. You're going to kill me.",7
MULDER,"No, I'm not, but I'd like to.",7
SCULLY,Deputy...,1
DEPUTY GREER,The FBI? For real?,4
SCULLY,I'll be in the car.,5
DEPUTY GREER,I got to at least make out a report.,9
MULDER,"No, no, no. Not before you help me finish what you interrupted.",12
DEPUTY GREER,"Yes, sir. May I have my gun, please?",8
DEPUTY GREER,Thank you.,2
MULDER,Come on. .,2
SCULLY,Yeah. No... Thank you.,4
MULDER,No one in the bathroom. The deputy helped me pull off the plywood. There's no sign of anything except more of that slime in the bathtub and maybe three inches of water on the floor. It's weird. It's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door.,50
SCULLY,"Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close the airport. I think we better get out of here.",16
MULDER,Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?,9
SCULLY,"Yes, I'm curious, Mulder but I'm also suspicious. I mean, I... I think that Mr. Dales' story is fueled by more than his imagination and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball.",34
MULDER,Don't dismiss him so easily. He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago. He's seen things that I've only read about.,20
SCULLY,"Because sea monsters can only be read about, Mulder, because they don't exist.",13
MULDER,If the sea is where life began-- where our ancestors first walked ashore-- then who's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths.,27
SCULLY,"You know what? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family. Mulder, look-- there is nothing more for us to do here. There's nothing that local law enforcement can't do for us. I mean, these people are missing. There's nowhere else to look. I've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales for my conscience... I mean, haven't you?",58
MULDER,"Well, we should at least tell him that we're giving up... shouldn't we?",13
DEPUTY GREER,Sea monsters... FBI agents... I'm the one who could use a drink.,12
ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY,"How do you do, folks? You're going to have to turn around and find yourself someplace dry to spend the night.",21
MULDER,"What's the problem, officer?",4
ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY,The road's washed out up ahead.,6
SCULLY,This is an emergency.,4
ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY,"I understand, ma'am but unless your car has wings there's no getting through on this road.",16
SCULLY,"Well, what about the airport? Is there an alternate route?",10
ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY,"Airport? No, not tonight. This hurricane's really bearing down on us. We got trees, power lines down all over the place. You folks really shouldn't be out here. I want you to drive to the first safe place you can find. You understand?",43
SCULLY,"Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area. We're FBI agents and we need to get to where we're going.",20
ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY,Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.,8
SCULLY,I'd be happy to show you my I.D…,8
MULDER,"Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate the concern.",9
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,I was just one howdy do over the line.,9
DISPATCHER,"Car 54, please report back to base.",7
DEPUTY GREER,"Yeah, this is car 54. I'm over at Nance Road, over.",11
DISPATCHER,We're asking all mobile units to stay off the roads due to extreme weather conditions forecast for the next three to four hours including a flash flood warning now in effect for Collier County. Over.,35
DEPUTY GREER,"10-4. I'm going to make a quick stop in at the Breakers condo complex. Looks like some folks are stranded without power, over.",23
DISPATCHER,"10-4, Deputy Greer. Please be advised that we won't be able to give you backup or assistance.",17
DEPUTY GREER,"It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff. If you're home, please answer the door. If you can hear me, but you can't answer the door call 911, tell them you need help. Hello? It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff. If you're home, answer the door. If you can hear me, but can't answer the door call 911, tell them you need help.",59
DEPUTY GREER,Hello? Hello? Somebody here?,4
DEPUTY GREER,"Sir? Ma'am? Oh, my god.",5
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MULDER,"The good thing about zero visibility, Scully? Can't get any worse.",11
SCULLY,"Is this the Collier County Sheriff? Yes. Oh, hi. We're driving on, uh...",13
MULDER,Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.,4
SCULLY,"Nance Road. No, it isn't very smart, is it? No... Yes, that would be much appreciated. He's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter.",26
MULDER,Not a moment too soon.,5
SCULLY,Hello? Hello... No service.,4
MULDER,"You know, Scully, someday we're going to look back on this and we're going to laugh. We'll just think of it as, uh... you know man pitted against the forces of nature. Think of it as a test of our mettle.",41
SCULLY,I don't need my mettle tested.,6
SCULLY,What was that?,3
MULDER,I think that was a-a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.,12
SCULLY,"Mulder, we have to pull over. We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees.",18
MULDER,"We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car. At least if we're driving, we're a moving target.",20
SCULLY,We don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going.,13
MULDER,"There's somebody, I think who's about to give us directions. Who says there's never a cop when you need one?",20
SCULLY,"Mulder, isn't that...",3
MULDER,Forrest Gump.,2
SCULLY,"Deputy? Hello? Anybody... Mulder, he's in here.",7
SCULLY,Can you talk to me?,5
SCULLY,You're having trouble breathing? This man needs a trach or he's going to die real soon.,16
MULDER,I've heard of passing the time... Ouch.,7
SCULLY,"Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady. Deputy, if you can hear me, just try and relax. Okay. Here we go.",24
MULDER,Looks like he was attacked or stung. What are those?,10
SCULLY,I don't know but he's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response.,14
MULDER,"Whatever it was, I think it came through the plumbing, through the toilet.",13
SCULLY,All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as possible.,17
MULDER,If it's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this building.,16
SCULLY,This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I need a medivac unit out here ASAP.,20
SCULLY,I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance.,10
OPERATOR,"Please state your name again, ma'am.",6
SCULLY,My name is Dana... Scully.,5
ARTHUR DALES,": Scully! Oh, god.",3
SCULLY,I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit for a sheriff's deputy who is injured.,15
OPERATOR,You have a deputy down?,5
SCULLY,I have a deputy who's been attacked by something as yet unidentified.,12
ARTHUR DALES,Unidentified? My ass!,3
OPERATOR,"What's his condition, ma'am?",4
SCULLY,"His vitals are weak and he's in shock. Now, I need him taken to a hospital right away.",18
MULDER,"Excuse me, sir. Is everything okay in your apartment?",9
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,"Uh, yeah, yeah. It's all good.",6
MULDER,Do you need some help... with your television?,8
WALTER,I thought I heard voices. Thank god! We didn't think anybody was coming. Are you doctors?,16
MULDER,No. Do you need medical help?,6
WALTER,"Yeah. We called 911, but no one came and everyone else is already evacuated. We don't have a car and then the phone died.",24
MULDER,Who's we? Who are you talking about?,7
WALTER,"My wife and I. She's pregnant-- a week past her due date. God, I hope one of you has a car.",21
MULDER,"You don't know this man, mister...?",6
WALTER,"Uh, Suarez. Walter Suarez. Uh, no. He's not with you?",10
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,I'll put it back.,4
MULDER,"Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too.",6
WALTER,"She's right over here. Right this way. Angela this is, uh, Mister...",12
MULDER,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"Stay there, Mrs. Suarez. We're going to make sure your baby makes it safely into the world.",17
ANGELA,"Well, thank you, but I'm not in labor. And my name is not ""Suarez."" It's Villareal. He tells people I'm his wife. Like he's so macho.",26
MULDER,"Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me.",18
ANGELA,"Why? You got a car? Oh, Walter, here, doesn't have a car. Not to mention a job.",17
MULDER,"Right now, I just want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.",15
ANGELA,From what?,2
MULDER,I don't know but it may have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.,12
WALTER,Who? Where?,2
MULDER,In the manager's apartment. It could be in the complex's plumbing now.,12
WALTER,In the plumbing?,3
ANGELA,That's great. I have to go to the bathroom about every ten seconds.,13
MULDER,Kid's going to be a fighter. Anybody else in the complex that you know of?,15
WALTER,"No, no one... Oh, there's George.",6
MULDER,George?,1
WALTER,"Yeah, George Vincent. He lives on the first floor. I went and asked him for help but he just yelled ""go away."" He never listens to no one.",28
MULDER,He's going to want to listen to me.,8
ANGELA,Walter!,1
WALTER,Better go.,2
MULDER,It's for you.,3
MULDER,Mr. Vincent! George Vincent!,4
GEORGE VINCENT,Quit banging on the damn door!,6
MULDER,"I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent. I'm asking you to open the door.",13
GEORGE,You ask away. Then go away.,6
MULDER,"Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment.",15
GEORGE,"You may be in danger if you refuse to quit harassing me. Now, I'm armed in here and I'm within my rights.",22
MULDER,"Well, that's great. But you may not be armed for what it is I'm talking about.",16
GEORGE,"What the hell are you talking about? Hmm? It don't matter. I'm armed against it. The Junta, Cuba and Castro. I'm not going to cede my home to no revolutionaries without a fight. You got anything else you want to throw at me-- you bring it on.",47
MULDER,All the nuts roll down to Florida.,7
SCULLY,He's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body. His condition's worsening.,14
ANGELA,I can see that. What the hell was chewing on his neck?,12
SCULLY,I don't know. It may have been some kind of a water-borne parasite.,13
ANGELA,Uh huh. You see that? You see what happens when you live in a dump?,15
WALTER,Where's Harry?,2
SCULLY,I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.,8
ANGELA,The slumlord who owns this place.,6
SCULLY,He may have evacuated.,4
ANGELA,Harry? Right. And I'm giving birth to the Christ child.,10
WALTER,Harry's legs hardly work. He's got to use those crutches.,10
ANGELA,He don't have no car. Nobody likes him 'cause he never lifts a finger on this rat trap.,18
MULDER,"Scully, can I talk to you for a second?",9
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
ANGELA,"Now, who are you?",4
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,Nobody.,1
ANGELA,"Nobody? Oh, well, it is so nice to be surrounded by so many great men.",15
MULDER,We got to out of here as soon as possible.,10
SCULLY,We can't.,2
MULDER,We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital.,14
SCULLY,"Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time. The roads are impassable, and I don't even know if the deputy is movable in this condition.",35
MULDER,You mean we're stuck here?,5
SCULLY,It looks that way. At least until the weather breaks.,10
GEORGE,"Federal agents-- jack-booted fascists bent on trampling the rights of the common man. Don't need their damn help defending my home. Violence in the pursuit of freedom is no vice. Because all that's needed for tyranny to prevail is for good men to do nothing. country against those that would spit at the constitution and take a leak on the bill of rights. My cause is just, my will is strong and my heart is that of a warrior. Anyone who wants a piece of me, let 'em bring it on.",91
SCULLY,"I don't think these wounds are bites or stings. There's something in here, Mulder, right under the skin. Tongs. Mulder, what's his temperature?",23
MULDER,"Well, either he's got no temperature or he's about to spontaneously combust.",12
SCULLY,"You're not far off. It's 106. Okay, somebody fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer.",25
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,B-but that thing is in the... plumbing.,7
SCULLY,"Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his temperature down he's not going to survive this. Now get moving.",21
SCULLY,We need to put this man in ice water as soon as possible.,13
SCULLY,"I need a container. Mulder, lift him up. We have to get him into the tub.",16
MULDER,Mr. Vincent?,2
MULDER,Drop your weapon! Put it down!',6
GEORGE,It's gonna take a whole lot more than this to kill whatever it is I just saw.,17
GEORGE,I don't know what the hell it was but it came down out of there.,15
MULDER,You didn't see it?,4
GEORGE,I caught it out of the corner of my eye but it swooped down at me. I...,17
SCULLY,All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.,9
GEORGE,"No, no, this thing came at me.",7
MULDER,That looks like the four- inch tie-in to the second floor. Whatever it is didn't just rip through the ceiling. Looks like it ripped right through the pipe.,28
WALTER,Where did it go?,4
MULDER,I don't know. It must still be in the building. It's probably in the outflow system.,16
WALTER,"Well, maybe it'll just flow back out.",7
GEORGE,Or maybe it'll come up through the can and grab you by the nugs.,14
MULDER,Someone's already got him by the nugs.,7
SCULLY,"Look, you guys, whatever this thing is there's no evidence yet that it's going to kill anybody.",17
WALTER,"Well, what about the man in the bathtub?",8
SCULLY,"The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last out this storm. In fact, we may all be safe if we just remain calm.",30
ANGELA,"""Remain calm?"" I got to pee so bad my back teeth are swimming.",13
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,Victory.,1
SCULLY,How is he?,3
DOUGIE THE LOOTER,H-he's good.,2
ANGELA,Supertanker coming through.,3
WALTER,"Here, Angela, you can't go in there.",7
ANGELA,"My bladder is pressing against your unborn child, Walter. He's going to have a head like a tortilla.",18
WALTER,This thing is in the plumbing!,6
ANGELA,The volume alone could push it right back out to sea.,11
MULDER,"Scully, that's how this thing is here. The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up god knows what and this thing must have been driven into the city's reclamation system through some offshore outfall pipe. From there it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building.",46
SCULLY,We'll be waiting for you out here.,7
ANGELA,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,"Mulder, nothing I've seen convinces me there's a monster … don't think we can assume George Vincent gave us a factual account of what took place in his apartment. ]",29
ANGELA,"I know you probably can't hear me but no listening anyway, okay?",12
MULDER,"Scully, something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean-- something that had been lying there undiscovered for ages, probably.",22
SCULLY,"Mulder, there is no evidence of any creature here. Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites, but something from Jules Verne they are not.",25
ANGELA,I saw it! I saw it! It's in the tub with the deputy. It has giant arms like an octopus.,20
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
GEORGE,What the hell is it?,5
MULDER,He's gone.,2
SCULLY,It's gone?,2
MULDER,No. He's gone. The deputy.,5
SCULLY,Where'd he go?,3
MULDER,I think the deputy went out with the bathwater.,9
GEORGE,And he was... he was in there with it?,9
MULDER,"No, I don't think he was.",6
WALTER,"Well, she said she saw it.",6
MULDER,"I'm sure she did. Look, Scully, I think I know why nobody's ever seen this thing before. It, it just doesn't live in water. It is water, taking shape only when it attacks, like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing. Virtually unseeable until then.",48
SCULLY,"Mulder, if that were true then this wouldn't be visible, would it? I mean, what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it.",27
MULDER,Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process. Maybe it needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys.,21
SCULLY,"Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.",8
MULDER,"No, they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was here-- using their bodies to lay its own spawn-- using the body's water content to reproduce itself-- to make itself anew.",33
WALTER,"You mean, he turned into one of those things?",9
ANGELA,There are more of them?,5
MULDER,We got to get out of here.,7
SCULLY,We're in the middle of a hurricane.,7
MULDER,We got to get to another building.,7
SCULLY,"Mulder, we cant. There's no way we can transport everybody.",10
MULDER,"We can use the deputy's Prowler. How many people? We got two, four... … son of a bitch.",18
WALTER,The looter?,2
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Yeah?,1
SCULLY,"Mulder, if we're going to leave we should leave now.",10
[CLOSED CAPTIONING,"MULDER: He took the Prowler, Scully.]",6
SCULLY,"Mulder?! Hey, Mulder, are you okay?",6
SCULLY,Hey... wait a second. What are you doing?!,8
GEORGE,I am saving our lives.,5
SCULLY,That's my partner out there!,5
GEORGE,If he's your partner he should have listened to you.,10
SCULLY,You can't just leave him there!,6
GEORGE,I'm not letting him in.,5
SCULLY,He'll die!,2
WALTER,What are you going to do for him?,8
SCULLY,"Well, I can at least keep him breathing!",8
WALTER,You couldn't save the deputy.,5
SCULLY,"Look, at least let me try. I'm a medical doctor.",10
ANGELA,That's good... because my water just broke.,7
WALTER,You're going to be okay.,5
ANGELA,"Yeah, that's easy for you to say.",7
GEORGE,"Isn't much of a choice, really, is it?",8
SCULLY,We're going to need water. If I'm going to deliver this baby you can put that gun down.,18
GEORGE,How do we know you're really a doctor?,8
SCULLY,You don't. The truth is I've never delivered a baby before. So stand back or make yourself useful but stay out of my way.,24
WALTER,"Long, even breath!",3
SCULLY,"You got it. Breathe... Breathe. Okay, Angela, I'm going to need you to push, okay? I need you to help me help you. Okay. So let's push.",27
SCULLY,"You got it. You got it. You're on the right track. I'm going to need some towels, please.",18
SCULLY,"I need some towels, damn it!",6
SCULLY,"You're doing good. You're doing good. Okay. You're doing good. Okay. Let's go. Okay, push.",15
SCULLY,I can feel it up there!,6
WALTER,She can feel it up there!,6
SCULLY,"Okay, come on. Puuush! Good! You got it. Okay. Here it comes.",12
WALTER,Here it comes.,3
SCULLY,Here it comes. It's coming. Okay.,6
GEORGE,"Hey, lady, what are you doing?",6
SCULLY,It's the water.,3
WALTER,What? What?,2
SCULLY,It's the water!,3
ANGELA,I'm having it! I'm having it! I'm having it!,9
SCULLY,Okay!,1
ANGELA,I'm having it!,3
SCULLY,Push!,1
ANGELA,I'm having it!,3
SCULLY,It's coming! Push! Push!,4
SCULLY,Okay!,1
GEORGE,Help!,1
SCULLY,"Okay, now pick up the gun.",6
GEORGE,Help! Aah!,2
SCULLY,Pick up the gun!,4
WALTER,Where?,1
SCULLY,Shoot out the sprinklers! Just point and shoot! Shoot out the sprinklers!,12
ARTHUR DALES,"Yes, yes. Eww, god.",4
ARTHUR DALES,That's terrible.,2
SCULLY,"Well, it's official. Ten pounds, ten ounces of piss and vinegar. El nino grande-- Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez, Jr.",19
MULDER,"Oh, no.",2
SCULLY,"Oh, yes.",2
ARTHUR DALES,"Oh, it's amazing. It's truly amazing.",6
SCULLY,What's that?,2
ARTHUR DALES,"That you could come here in the face of a hurricane chasing a sea monster, yet, and end up bringing a new... life into the world. And then slaying the monster and save this one's life as he was quite literally circling down the drain.",45
MULDER,"She didn't save my life, really...",6
ARTHUR DALES,"Oh, yes, she did. Yes, with a gun to her head, no less.",13
SCULLY,"Well, you wouldn't have known to go out in the rain if I hadn't pointed it out that to you that it was the fresh water that killed the organism...",30
MULDER,No. No no no no … I-I saw the Shipley's cat.,11
ARTHUR DALES,"Uh, well, I-I can't swallow that... No, no, no.",9
MULDER,"I saw the cat, which had been saved which had been in the washing machine. And the Shipleys had boarded up their house which means that the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater … seawater. And then the deputy who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts.",62
ARTHUR DALES,"If Agent Scully had not been there with you I shudder to think what would have happened to you. I'd say you owe her your life. It takes a big man to admit this, but... if I had had someone as savvy as her by my side all those years ago in the X-Files I might not have retired. I suggest that we have a toast to your good fortune. And I insist that we have it. So... what'll it be?",81
ARTHUR DALES,"A little of the... oh, uh... anyone for water?",9
MULDER AND SCULLY,No.,1
