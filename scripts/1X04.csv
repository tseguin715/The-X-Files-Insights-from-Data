MAN WITH DOGS,"Easy, easy.",2
POLICE OFFICER,His leg's been eaten off.,5
POLICE OFFICER 2,"HEEYY, UP HERE. IT'S IN HERE. IT'S AS TALL AS A HOUSE.",12
POLICE OFFICER 3,We can smoke him out.,5
POLICE OFFICER,And then what?,3
POLICE OFFICER 2,I SEE IT.,3
POLICE OFFICER,He's coming at us.,4
SCULLY,Working hard Mulder?,3
MULDER,This woman claims to have been taken aboard a spaceship and held in an anti-gravity chamber without food and water for three days.,23
SCULLY,"Anti-gravity's right. Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation, but I just heard a story that'd just about take your knees out.",21
MULDER,What's that?,2
SCULLY,"They found a body in the New Jersey woods yesterday, missing it's right arm and shoulder. They think they may have been eaten off, by a human.",27
MULDER,Where in New Jersey?,4
SCULLY,Just outside Atlantic City.,4
MULDER,Not an uncommon place to lose a body part. They think it's the mob?,14
SCULLY,"Mmma, it was a homeless man. There doesn't seem to be a motive.",13
MULDER,You feeling lucky Scully?,4
SCULLY,"Relative to whom? It's not our case Mulder, the local police are handling it. An X-File?",16
MULDER,Ever hear of something called The Jersey Devil?,8
SCULLY,"Yeah, it's a beast that's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars, right. Kind of like an East Coast Bigfoot.",23
MULDER,Read the file about the case in 1947.,8
SCULLY,Save me the trouble.,4
MULDER,"1947, family watches dad get dragged off into the woods, cops find dad with a few appendages gnawed off. Cops corner a large naked man in the woods and gun `im down. Autopsy shows human flesh and bones in the man's large intestine. A beast man. Requisition for a car please.",51
SCULLY,Is the autopsy report in here?,6
MULDER,"No, the original disappeared from the Patterson PD's files a few years after the incident. But there is a statement from the attending pathologist.",24
SCULLY,"Mulder it's the same story I've heard since I was a kid. It's a folk tale, a myth.",18
MULDER,"I heard the same story when I was a kid too, funny thing is, I believed it. Thanks Doreen. Fact is, we got a cannibalised body in New Jersey, someone or something out there is hungry.",36
GLENNA,"Er, they say animals can develop an appetite for human flesh but, this is no animal. You see the teeth marks, just below the clavicle, they're human.",27
MULDER,Who found the body?,4
GLENNA,Park Ranger.,2
SCULLY,Was he alive when it happened?,6
GLENNA,"Well, it's hard to tell. CORONER'S DEPARTMENT NAME CROCKETT ROGER CASE NO. 2272",13
DATE AUG 29 / 93 WHERE TAKEN FROM,"N.J. STATE PARK There's a scull fracture but no sign of a struggle, his blood alcohol level was up, probably never knew what hit him.",25
MULDER,Any ideas about that?,4
GLENNA,"The size of that bite mark, I'd say.......",8
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,I want this on the QT.,6
GLENNA,.......large adult male.,3
MAN,I'll do my best.,4
GLENNA,"Er, Detective Thompson is handling the case.",7
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Glenna?,1
SCULLY,"Hi, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder.",12
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"I don't remember anybody calling the, FBI in on this.",10
MULDER,"Well we're not here on an official capacity, Agent Scully's a medical doctor, we heard about your victim and, she thought she might take a look.",26
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"I'm sorry, I'm gonna ask you to leave. We have an investigation.",12
GLENNA,"For God's sakes Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.",11
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,We have jurisdiction here.,4
MULDER,Any suspects yet Detective?,4
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"I don't work for you sir, and unless you hear different from the Attorney General, er, this case is a local matter.",22
SCULLY,"Agent Mulder, we should go.",5
MULDER,There's no need to get bent outta shape.,8
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"On the contrary, I think I've been exceedingly polite.",9
MULDER,So what's eating that guy?,5
SCULLY,"He was perfectly in his rights. The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction in a murder case. Anyway, you'd feel the same way if someone was horning in on your work.",30
MULDER,"Yeah, chances are he's without a clue. He'll probably be scratching his head when they bring the next body in.",20
SCULLY,"You missed your opening Mulder, you could've really humiliated him and er, told him who the perpetrator was, The Jersey Devil.",21
MULDER,"Hey whatta you say, we grab a hotel, take in a floor show, drop a few quarters in the slot, do a little digging on this case.",27
SCULLY,You're kidding right.,3
MULDER,"Ok, we can skip the floor show.",7
SCULLY,Mulder I have to be back in D.C.,8
MULDER,What you gotta date?,4
SCULLY,"No, I have my godson's birthday party at 6:30. What are you doing?",13
MULDER,"A little poking around, maybe make a weekend out of it.",11
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's a three hour drive back by myself......in Friday night traffic, ooowh.",13
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Found the body just over there, lying face down in the rocks. Thirty-two years with the park service, I've come across some weird stuff but I tell ye, never anything like this.",32
MULDER,"Victim was a homeless man, you get many of them wandering around out here?",14
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Well, occasionally ar, see some but, most are scared of the woods.",12
MULDER,Scared? Of what?,3
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"I don't know, the devil.",5
MULDER,People say that's just a myth.,6
RANGER PETER BOULAY,Depends on who you talk to.,6
MULDER,What do you think?,4
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Well like I said, now thirty-two years, I see alot of weird stuff. Like one time, a little over four years ago, I saw what I thought was a, large man come out of a, copse of birch trees, not, not a stitch of clothing. And he was about, sixty yards away, and he starts, sniffing the air, you know like a dog. And then he looks straight at me, and I swear he smelled me because he took off into the woods so fast, you'd swear it wasn't human.",90
MULDER,Really. You never saw him again?,6
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"No, but I feel him. And, I found things, some scat, half buried like a cat's only more human. Found a half eaten rabbit with what looked like a human cuspid tooth in it. And some deer bones, looked like they'd been sharpened into tools.",45
MULDER,You think it might be what's responsible for the body you found?,12
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"I got a pension coming up in a few years, you know, you say the wrong thing.",17
MULDER,Yeah.,1
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Er, I'll tell you one thing, I don't ever come out here without my weapon anymore.",16
MULDER,How far is it into town from here?,8
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"`Bout a mile, mile and a half.",7
MULDER,"I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for the next couple of days, if you think of anything, will you call me?",21
RANGER PETER BOULAY,Sure.,1
SCULLY,"Oh c'mon, it's ok, it's alright, what happened, did you bump your head? Hhmmm.",14
ELLEN,"Oh Peter, stop that. What, what happened?",7
SCULLY,Jungle warfare.,2
ELLEN,"Aaar, I'm gonna kill that dog.",6
SCULLY,If the hit squad doesn't get to him before you do.,11
ELLEN,I'm so glad you're here Dana.,6
SCULLY,"Oooh, you're amazing.",3
ELLEN,What?,1
SCULLY,"You're just such a natural at all this, I don't know how you keep it all together.",17
ELLEN,Mommy radar.,2
SCULLY,"Mmmm, I don't think I'm cut out for this El.",10
ELLEN,"Dana, you went through the FBI academy, what better training could there be for motherhood. Seriously, you're great with kids, what're you talking about.",24
SCULLY,When am I supposed to find the time?,8
ELLEN,Well first you have to get a life.,8
SCULLY,Ooooh.,1
ELLEN,"And, of course, it helps if you can find a man.",11
SCULLY,Know of any?,3
ELLEN,"Yeah, they're disappearing faster than the Brazilian rain forest. What about that guy you work with?",16
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
ELLEN,"Yeah, I thought you said he was cute.",8
SCULLY,"He's a jerk. He's not a jerk, he's erm, he's obsessed with his work.",14
ROB,Hi.,1
SCULLY,Hi.,1
ROB,"I'm Rob, I'm Scott's dad.",5
SCULLY,"Oh, come in.",3
ROB,Thanks. Hey Tiger. How you doing? Are you having a good time?,12
ELLEN,Divorced.,1
MULDER,"Did anybody here know Roger Crockett? He was murdered two days ago. Ma'am, can I..",15
VAGRANT WOMAN,"Hey honey, have you got any change to spare?",9
MULDER,Roger Crockett? Anybody?,3
JACK,What d'you wanna know?,4
MULDER,Did you know Roger Crockett? Did you hear how he died?,11
JACK,Yeah.,1
MULDER,Any ideas who might've done it?,6
JACK,You a cop?,3
MULDER,"No, I'm FBI.",3
JACK,I'll show you something.,4
MULDER,Ok.,1
JACK,I need some money.,4
MULDER,What is this?,3
JACK,Stuck in the pocket of a jacket I found.,9
MULDER,Does it mean anything to you?,6
JACK,I've seen it.,3
MULDER,Where?,1
JACK,"Right here, digging in the trash..",6
MULDER,Here? Are you hustling me?,5
JACK,Swear to God.,3
MULDER,Who do you think it is?,6
JACK,"I don't know, scared the hell out of me.",9
MULDER,Has anybody else seen it?,5
JACK,"Oh yeah, everybody's pretty freaked.",5
MULDER,Anybody told the cops?,4
JACK,You think they don't know.,5
MULDER,Where're you sleeping tonight?,4
JACK,You're standing in my bedroom.,5
MULDER,"You know the er, The Galaxy Gateway? Room 756. Go ahead.",11
JACK,"Hey, they got HBO?",4
MULDER,"Yeah, they do.",3
POLICE OFFICER,Sir.,1
MULDER,You got a man up on that roof.,8
POLICE OFFICER,"Nothing to be afraid of, we're gonna give ye a warm place to sleep it off.",16
MULDER,Hey back off.,3
POLICE OFFICER,"Alright, calm down.",3
MULDER,"I'm telling you, there's a man up on that roof.",10
POLICE OFFICER,"Get in the car, now.",5
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,What the hell do you think you're doing?,8
MULDER,Enjoying the night life here in beautiful Atlantic City.,9
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"I'll go right to the D.A.'s office if I have to, obstructing an investigation, misconduct.",15
MULDER,"That's good, let's go see her together, and while we're at it, why don't we add withholding evidence to the list.",21
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Whatta you talking about?,4
MULDER,Statements given to you describing something stalking the back streets of Atlantic City.,13
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,This is the fishing trip they get me up at three-o-clock in the morning for. Unbelievable.,16
MULDER,Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight? You know it's out there.,14
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"I got a perpetrator out there. Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or Elmer Fudd, I've got a job, to protect people.",21
MULDER,"Oh is that your job, or is it to keep the dice rolling, keep the tour buses rolling in. You can't fill those casinos, this town disappears like a quarter down the slot. I've seen it.",36
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Seen what? You've been spending too much time in supermarket check-out lines. This story's as old as the hills.,19
MULDER,"Who's going to be responsible when you lose your first tourist, Detective? You are.",14
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"No, you are sir, because you're wasting my time, and impeding the solution of this case. You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your weekend.",34
AGENT,"Agent Scully, Agent Mulder line three.",6
SCULLY,Where are you?,3
MULDER,I'm not far from where you left me.,8
SCULLY,You're still in Atlantic City?,5
MULDER,"Er Scully, you got anything happening this morning?",8
SCULLY,What's that noise in the background?,6
MULDER,That's a guy getting sick.,5
SCULLY,Mulder where are you? The drunk tank.,7
SCULLY,"Well, it's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant.",13
MULDER,You gonna rag on me or you gonna take me to get something to eat?,15
SCULLY,Am I buying or did you manage to pan-handle some spare change while you were at it?,17
MULDER,"It moved like a cat, quick and graceful. There's no way a human could've got up on the roof that fast.",21
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,What's gonna happen when word of this gets back to the bureau?,12
MULDER,"They dropped the charges, that guy Thompson, he ran me through the system just to spite me.",17
SCULLY,I'm talking about this Jersey Devil thing.,7
MULDER,"I saw it, it's exactly the way the ranger described it, the way it moved, the way it sniffed the air. It's come out of the woods, probably in search of food.",32
SCULLY,"Hyeah, I'll say.",3
MULDER,"It was peeking through the garbage Scully, if it was a man-eater, why didn't it come after me? Probably felt threatened in some way..",24
SCULLY,"Mulder, listen to yourself. You're already ascribing it a motive and an alibi. This thing, chewing somebody's arm off is not exactly a defensive posture.",25
MULDER,"But you do believe that I saw something, don't ye?",10
SCULLY,"You saw something, I'll give you that but I'm not about to go in and sell it. Not when it's nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley.",29
MULDER,I still got a hotel room I'm paying for.,9
SCULLY,"Yeah well, I have got to get back to Washington by 7:30, so er..",14
MULDER,Another birthday party?,3
SCULLY,No. I have a date.,5
MULDER,Can you cancel?,3
SCULLY,"Unlike you Mulder, I would like to have a life.",10
MULDER,I have a life!,4
SCULLY,"C'mon, I have somebody I want you to meet, on the way home. C'mon.",14
DR. DIAMOND,"Just about every culture has one. Yetis, Sasquatch, Russian Almas, Dsonoqua.",11
MULDER,Why is that?,3
DR. DIAMOND,"Oh, it's a kind of universal wild man myth. A symbolic fear of our dual natures as humans, as creators of life and destroyers of it.",26
MULDER,What's this chart?,3
DR. DIAMOND,"It shows the historic entry of man onto each continent and the effect it had on other animal species, which as you see has been disastrous.",26
MULDER,Why?,1
DR. DIAMOND,"Well, we humans have retained hereditary traits through evolution that have proven to be extremely destructive. We tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial, oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives that make, co-operation beyond the family-a-tribe, extremely hard for us.",41
MULDER,So we kill other species in order to survive.,9
SCULLY,"Yeah, humans are top carnivores, we sit at the top of the food chain and we, reduce other species' chance of survival.",22
DR. DIAMOND,Nice to know Dana left here with more than a degree.,11
MULDER,But what if something entered the food chain above us?,10
DR. DIAMOND,"It won't happen, see our intelligence virtually insures us, barring the introduction of some alien life-form, we will live out our days as rulers of the world.",27
MULDER,"But, but what if through some fluke of nature, a human was born, who reverted to it's most animal instincts, a kind of carnivorous neanderthal. Wouldn't he occupy a space above us on the food chain?",36
DR. DIAMOND,"Oh sure, all he'd have to do is wait outside any fast-food restaurant and eat us on the way in.",20
MULDER,"Right, yeah, an.and, and haven't there been cases were, men have been raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators?",26
DR. DIAMOND,"Oh yes several, but you see cannibalism is rare, even among the lower mammals.",14
MULDER,But even when faced with extinction?,6
DR. DIAMOND,"Well maybe in the jungles of New Gineau or, it's just, highly unlikely that what you're suggesting could've survived civilization, a revolution, out in the woods of New Jersey.",29
MULDER,"Yea, highly unlikely, but not outside the realm of extreme possibility?",11
DR. DIAMOND,"Well, it would be an amazing discovery.",7
ROB,Well the hard thing was when my wife remarried I... Suddenly I felt very competitive for my son's attention. It was weird.,22
SCULLY,I'm sure.,2
ROB,"I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott, I, had this unconscious fear of being replaced. I actually had dreams where I was running over his step-father with my car. Well, you'll understand when you have kids, having kids changes everything.",42
SCULLY,That's what they say.,4
ROB,"Maybe some weekend, if you're up for it, we could er, take the kids out to the beach for the day.",21
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
ROB,"Great. Thank you. So, can I ask about the case you're on or, can't you say.",16
SCULLY,I don't think it's a case we should discuss over dinner.,11
ROB,"I don't suppose you'd wanna hear about the, finer points of the state planning and taxation.",16
MULDER,Mulder.,1
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Agent Mulder, this is Peter Boulay of the Jersey Parks Department.",11
MULDER,"Oh yeah, hi.",3
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Hi, I found a body out in the woods today, it looks like it's been dead about six to eight months. A long haired male, missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit a while back. It could be your devil.",42
MULDER,Where's the body now?,4
RANGER PETER BOULAY,I turned it over to the coroner's office.,8
MULDER,You're sure it was a male?,6
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Well, it had all the plumbing.",6
ROB,Excuse me.,2
SCULLY,Eef-hhmmm. Sorry. Excuse me.,4
ROB,Certainly.,1
MULDER,Scully.,1
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,Sorry to interrupt your evening.,5
SCULLY,"That's ok, what's up?",4
MULDER,"I just had an amazing thought, maybe it isn't a beast-man we're looking for after all.",16
GLENNA,"Well, if they picked it up, nobody logged the body on the chart. I sure haven't seen it.",18
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Well, I don't understand. What else would they have done with it?",12
SCULLY,I'm afraid we may have called you down here for nothing.,11
MULDER,They're going to try and sweep this whole thing under the carpet.,12
DR. DIAMOND,Why?,1
MULDER,"Any publicity and you're got the streets crawling with the kind of people who aren't here to play the crap tables. Word gets out there's something still on the loose, forget it.",32
DR. DIAMOND,You said it was a female.,6
MULDER,"The body they found was a male, there's a fifty-fifty chance there was a mate. We may never know unless we find out ourselves.",24
DR. DIAMOND,"If it's true, what're the chances of catching it alive?",10
DR. DIAMOND,"If it is a primate, it would have a natural fear of heights. It would also want to stay close to it's food source.",24
MULDER,This thing has no fear of heights. We'll stay together and start with the lower floors. How much time will that dart give us?,24
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"It'll put down a five hundred pound bear for an hour, if I hit it.",15
POLICE OFFICER 1,What the hell's a park ranger vehicle doing here?,9
POLICE OFFICER 2,I don't know.,3
POLICE OFFICER 1,Check it out.,3
POLICE OFFICER 2,Run a check for me on a...,7
DR. DIAMOND,Something here. It's blood. She could be bringing her killing here. She could be injured.,15
S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER,"Roger, zebra team in position.",5
MULDER,What if it is a female Scully? How close is she to you or me? Does she feel emotion? Or are her days just spent looking for food?,28
SCULLY,"Maybe, she spends her day shopping.",6
MULDER,"Eight million years out of Africa, I don't think we're all that different.",13
SCULLY,"Mulder, we've put men into space, we've built computers that work faster than the human mind.",16
MULDER,While we over-populate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with. Maybe we're just beasts with big brains. What?,22
SCULLY,"No I was just, thinking about my godson's birthday party, eight little six year old boys running around, talk about primitive behaviour.",22
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"Now look, his name is Mulder and he's a federal agent, you ever hear of him?",16
DR. DIAMOND,No.,1
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,You know him?,3
DR. DIAMOND,No.,1
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Well what are you doing here?,6
DR. DIAMOND,I'm a professor of Anthropology.,5
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,"Mulder, does that sound familar to you? Look, I know he's here somewhere. Would you check you upstairs Andrew, go check upstairs. I want this place searched...",27
SCULLY,Mulder? Mulder where are you?,5
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Scully.,1
SCULLY,"Lay back. Oh, Mulder you're hurt.",6
MULDER,"You should've seen her, she was beautiful.",7
SCULLY,"Yeah well, she just about ripped your lungs out.",9
MULDER,"She could've torn my head off Scully but she didn't, she sensed that I wasn't a threat..",17
AMBULANCE DUDE,You've gotta hold still.,4
SCULLY,Yeah I need to talk somebody who can get me federal jurisdiction on this case. Mulder.,16
MULDER,What?,1
DR. DIAMOND,How old would you say she was?,7
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"The US assistant D.A.'s on the phone with the bureau right now, he wants to know what the hell is going on up here in Atlantic City.",27
MULDER,"Well tell him he's got a real live neanderthal on the loose. She was young, I, I, I don't know...It's hard to say exactly what, what, what...",27
SCULLY,The Atlantic City major crime unit has filed a complaint that we're endangering a murder investigation.,16
MULDER,"That is such crap, you can..",6
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"Agent Mulder, they got her cornered, in a building.",9
MULDER,Let's go.,2
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Can you see it?,4
S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER,It crawled into the walls.,5
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Can you get a man in there?,7
S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER,That's affirmative.,2
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,And keep these people outta here.,6
MULDER,You could take her alive.,5
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,What's going on in there?,5
S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER,"I got a man down, I got a naked woman just jumped from a second storey window. Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot.",26
RANGER PETER BOULAY,"I know these woods, if she's going for cover, she'll be down by the rocks. Look.",16
MULDER,Can you reach her from here?,6
RANGER PETER BOULAY,I can try.,3
VOICES,I got it. Up ahead. I got it. She tried to take my arm off. Watch it right here. Right there. Looks like she was trying to bury herself.,29
MULDER,Why did you have to kill her?,7
DETECTIVE THOMPSON,Same reason you kill a rabid animal.,7
SCULLY,"Hi, this just came through, it's the posthumous medical exam on the woman's body. They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract, they estimated her age to be twenty-five to thirty years. Now they allowed Dr. Diamond to do a medical exam of the body but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology. Now the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe, and a search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun, in earnest.",83
MULDER,Good luck.,2
SCULLY,"They have also released the medical exam from the male body that they found, his age is estimated to be about forty years.",23
MULDER,There would have been offspring.,5
SCULLY,The medical exam of the women's uterus does seem to indicate that she may have given birth.,17
MULDER,"She was just protecting her children Scully, it all makes sense. The male dies and she comes out of the woods in search of food.",25
SCULLY,"Mulder will you do me a favour, will you just go out and have a beer, will you take the day off. I'll cover for you, will you just, take some time for yourself.",34
MULDER,"Thanks for the offer but I've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with.....an ethno-biologist, I can't wait to tell him about this. Mulder, yeah just a second, it's for you.",30
SCULLY,Hello?,1
ROB,"Hi Dana, it's Rob.",4
SCULLY,Oh hi.,2
ROB,"Sorry to call you at work, it's just I have Scott for the night and er, we have two extra tickets for Cirque De Soliel, we thought maybe you'd like to ask Ellen if you could take Trent and join us.",41
MULDER,Requisition for a car please Fran. Thank you. Who was that on the phone?,14
SCULLY,A guy.,2
MULDER,A guy. Same guy as the guy you had dinner with the other night?,14
SCULLY,Same guy.,2
MULDER,You gonna have dinner with him again?,7
SCULLY,I don't think so.,4
MULDER,No interest?,2
SCULLY,Not at this time.,4
MULDER,Thanks Fran. What are you doing?,6
SCULLY,I'm going with you to the Smithsonian.,7
MULDER,Don't you have a life Scully?,6
SCULLY,Keep that up Mulder and I'll hurt you like that beast-woman.,11
MULDER,Eight million years out of Africa.,6
SCULLY,Look who's holding the door.,5
BOY,"Dad, did you just see something down there?",8
DAD,Where?,1
BOY,Over there.,2
DAD,"Naah, I'm sure it was nothing.",6
BOY,"No, I saw something.",4
DAD,"Hey, did you ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil? You know when I was a kid, my dad used to tell this story about a creature who lived out down the woods...",34
