CHRIS CARTER,Previously on The X Files... Scenes from Essence,8
MULDER,Tell us about Billy Miles.,5
KRYCEK,Call them what you want-- human replacements or alien replicants.,10
KRYCEK,They're virtually unstoppable.,3
KNOWLE ROHRER,"I tell you things, but this is a whole other level.",11
MULDER,"It's you who's in danger now, Scully.",7
SCULLY,They want my baby. Why?,5
KRYCEK,Your baby was a miracle.,5
MULDER,"If we're going to get SCULLY out of here, we're going to need some help.",15
KRYCEK,She may never even make it out of this building.,10
KRYCEK,You should all know what it is you're up against. What Agent Scully's up against. There are others just like him.,21
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,"Dr. Langenhahn, here's the body.",5
DR. LANGENHAHN,They weren't kidding were they?,5
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,They said they did about the best they could considering it was all mashed in with that garbage.,18
DR. LANGENHAHN,How mashed up is it?,5
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,"Basically, it's hamburger.",3
DR. LANGENHAHN,Ohh... Ugggh. And they want me to do what exactly?,10
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,Your order was to establish and confirm real fact of death.,11
DR. LANGENHAHN,I'd say he's dead. How about you?,7
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,"Yes, sir.",2
DR. LANGENHAHN,"Good. I'm going home. You fax me the paperwork by 9:00. I'll sign it, everybody's happy.",16
DR. LANGENHAHN,"Ah, crying out loud. See this? They left some... garbage... in with it.",13
PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT,Looks kind of like a vertebra. Only metallic.,8
DR. LANGENHAHN,Note it on the report... and fax me.,8
SCULLY,"Oh, god. I was hoping this was all a dream. When did the sun come up?",16
REYES,About six hours ago. Somewhere back in North Carolina.,9
SCULLY,Where are we?,3
REYES,"We just crossed into Georgia. Long way from home, Agent Scully.",11
SCULLY,Well under the circumstances...,4
REYES,Right. We can't be too safe.,6
SCULLY,"Are you all right, Agent Reyes?",6
REYES,I should ask how you're doing. I mean... You're the one who's going to have this baby.,17
SCULLY,"That's it, isn't it? What you're really worried about?",9
REYES,Aside from whatever danger we're in... Where we're going doesn't sound like... there's all that much in the way of a … facility. You know what I mean? I've never delivered a baby.,33
SCULLY,"Well, I've never had one. That makes us both beginners.",10
MULDER,This is a video grab from the DC morgue. It's Billy Miles.,12
SKINNER,How can that be?,4
DOGGETT,It can't be. It's impossible.,5
MULDER,"Yeah. It can't be, but it is. Walking out of the morgue looking like a new man.",17
DOGGETT,"His body was taken to the morgue in a little box, for god's sake.",14
KRYCEK,Like I told you. You can't stop him.,8
SKINNER,"Yeah, you know, you keep saying that, Krycek. So why don't you explain it to us because I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding it myself. Billy Miles was scraped out of the back of a garbage truck. I saw him go in, I saw him come out.",51
KRYCEK,"Well, I don't know if I can explain it in any technical sense, but... that's Billy Miles, without a doubt.",20
SKINNER,"You're sitting there for one reason, Krycek. Because you can explain it.",12
KRYCEK,I told you-- he's a human replacement. Some new kind of alien …,13
KRYCEK,…. created to aid in the repopulation of the planet.,10
MULDER,Which Scully is a threat to.,6
KRYCEK,If she has that baby.,5
DOGGETT,"Well, I don't care who he is or what you think he's made of there's no way he's going to find her. No way.",24
KRYCEK,"Well, maybe he's not but there are others out there just like him. And it's only a matter of time before they will.",23
AGENT CRANE,Agent Doggett? See you a moment?,6
AGENT CRANE,There's someone here to see you. His name is Knowle Rohrer. He says you know each other and what he's here for can't wait.,24
REYES,End of the road.,4
SCULLY,"Yeah. Literally. Anybody finds us out here, it really will be a miracle. Where exactly are we?",17
REYES,Democrat Hot Springs. According to Agent Doggett this is where people used to come for the waters-- until the springs dried up and they quit coming. He was born here.,30
SCULLY,"Really? Well that's... comforting. I guess. So, where do you want to set up?",14
REYES,Over here.,2
SCULLY,Any particular reason?,3
REYES,"I think I told you, I feel these energies about people and stuff and places. I found it works best to go with my instincts.",25
SCULLY,I'm getting a feeling myself.,5
SCULLY,"Well, there's no water from this rock. We're going to need some water and a place to boil it. Along with sterile supplies and a clean place to do this delivery.",31
REYES,I'm a little stiff from the drive.,7
SCULLY,Okay.,1
DOGGETT,"It's not like you, Knowle coming to see me when you make me work so hard to see you.",19
KNOWLE ROHRER,"This couldn't wait, John. It's about this thing you're pursuing.",10
DOGGETT,This thing?,2
KNOWLE ROHRER,This man you're after. I think you know what I'm talking about.,12
DOGGETT,"I think I'm confused, Knowle-- if it's a man or if it's a thing.",14
KNOWLE ROHRER,"It's military, John. It goes all the way to the top. I can't overstate the sensitivity. Let me say there was a rumored program out of the cold war. A plan to create a super-soldier.",35
DOGGETT,"Well, this kid I'm talking about was pretty damn super. Got right up out of a gutbucket and hit the ground running. Kid wasn't exactly what I'd call military material. In fact, they say he was an alien abductee.",39
KNOWLE ROHRER,"You got it half right, John.",6
DOGGETT,Which half?,2
KNOWLE ROHRER,What you're chasing is a prototype.,6
DOGGETT,Uh-huh. And this so-called prototype... what is he after?,9
KNOWLE ROHRER,"Oh, I think you know that, too, John. He's after your partner, Scully. You may not be aware that she was part of a program herself. Six years ago, Agent Scully was taken in a military operation staged as an abduction. They put a chip in the back of her neck to monitor her. It was also used to make her pregnant with the first organic version of that same super-soldier.",71
DOGGETT,What do you want from me?,6
KNOWLE ROHRER,Help us catch him so we can put him down before he finds her.,14
DOGGETT,You assume I know where she is.,7
KNOWLE ROHRER,Who does? Your superior?,4
KNOWLE ROHRER,"Whoever knows, his life's in danger, too. I want you to know.",12
SKINNER,"Sit down, Krycek.",3
SKINNER,Hey! What'd I tell you?! Hey!,6
SKINNER,Krycek! Krycek! Hold the door!,5
SKINNER,"Hold the door, Krycek! Krycek!",5
DOGGETT,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"You heard about this, right?",5
DOGGETT,How is he?,3
MULDER,He's got a concussion. They're going to keep him here for observation. Where were you when this all happened?,19
DOGGETT,"In my office, talking to somebody who warned me this might happen.",12
MULDER,Who?,1
MULDER,Skinner could've been killed. He's lucky he wasn't.,8
DOGGETT,He's an old friend. He tells me stuff I'm not supposed to know. I didn't want to believe it.,19
MULDER,What exactly did he tell you?,6
DOGGETT,"He said that Billy Miles isn't what you think he is. He's a product of a government program looking to build a super soldier. He said Agent Scully's a part of that program, too; that her pregnancy was triggered by a chip they put in her neck.",47
MULDER,I want to know who the hell you've been talking to—,11
MULDER,.--- who this trusted source of yours is who's been spinning this fantasy.,12
DOGGETT,His name's Knowle Rohrer. He's deep inside US Intelligence. I don't know much more than that.,16
MULDER,"Did he ever lie to you? Give you bad information, false leads?",12
MULDER,"Well, you have to think about it?",7
DOGGETT,He says Scully's in danger. He wants to stop this guy. How's that so different than what we're saying?,19
MULDER,"You didn't tell him where she is, did you?",9
DOGGETT,"No, but I'm beginning to think that the fact that I know is going to catch up with me if AD Skinner's any indication.",24
MULDER,"You don't tell anybody where she is. That's the deal, right? Not even me.",14
DOGGETT,What if something happens to me?,6
MULDER,"This, uh, trusted source of yours told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles. Did he happen to tell you how he plans to do this?",27
DOGGETT,No.,1
MULDER,"Right. Well, what do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he really is?",17
REYES,Dana... Come see what you think.,6
SCULLY,"Oh, my goodness. Look at this. Look at you. Wow.",10
REYES,I found them folded up in a cabinet upstairs. And a nice porcelain basin and a whole box of candles.,20
SCULLY,Do we have matches?,4
REYES,I've got a lighter.,4
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
REYES,Now all we need is some mood music. Like whale song.,11
SCULLY,Whale song?,2
REYES,"Yeah, they've got these recordings of whales talking to each other, calling back and forth.",15
REYES,I... I don't know. It's like... it's almost metaphysical.,9
REYES,"You're looking at me like... I don't know, I probably sound like a goof.",14
SCULLY,"No, no, it's not that. Um, I was thinking that you reminded me of someone that I was close to-- my sister.",22
REYES,You're not close to her still?,6
SCULLY,"Uh, she was killed... about five years ago... in my home. It was a terrible time.",16
SCULLY,"Oh, it's, uh... It's okay. Oh, thank you. Thank you for, um... putting this together and... it's not what I planned but, um... it's very nice.",26
SCULLY,What?,1
REYES,There's someone out there. Stay here.,6
REYES,Get out of the car! I'm a Federal Agent!,9
GAME WARDEN,I don't care who you are. Let's start by putting that weapon away. Just point it down now.,18
REYES,I'm a Federal Agent.,4
GAME WARDEN,I heard you the first time. Just let me see some identification.,12
REYES,Dana?,1
SCULLY,I'm sure that this looks untoward but my life is in danger. And my baby's. There's a man who's pursuing us and it is very important that he not find us here.,32
GAME WARDEN,"We get hunters in here taking deer and game off-season. I've heard every excuse in the book but this one's far too original. You don't, uh, plan to have it here?",31
REYES,"It's not as crazy as it sounds. I mean, I hope it's not. She's a doctor; she can coach me.",20
GAME WARDEN,And what if something goes wrong? If you're a doctor you know the risks. You're unprepared here.,17
SCULLY,This man... he's extremely dangerous.,5
GAME WARDEN,I got a first aid kit in my truck. It's pretty basic but better to have than not. I'll be back with some towels and proper swaddling.,27
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
MULDER,"Hey. You know, how is it that this friend of yours is so desperate for your help? And then when we want to reach him, all of a sudden he's unreachable, nowhere to be found?",35
DOGGETT,"I don't know, maybe he got wind. Maybe he got spooked. But I'm beginning to think it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.",24
MULDER,You told me that he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles. Are you telling me now that you think he's a liar?,25
DOGGETT,He is or he isn't. What the hell difference does it really make?,13
MULDER,It doesn't make any difference at all. Unless you want to protect Scully and that baby.,16
DOGGETT,And then what? How long can you keep this up? How long until the next Billy Miles rears his head? The next threat? The next phantom? You ever stop to ask yourself?,32
DOGGETT,"All the sacrifice, the blood spilled-- you've given nearly a decade of your life. Where the hell is it all going to end?",23
MULDER,I don't know. Maybe it doesn't.,6
MULDER,Start the car.,3
DOGGETT,What?,1
MULDER,Alex Krycek just pulled in.,5
DOGGETT,What the hell is he doing here? How did he get security clearance?,13
MULDER,You recognize his passenger?,4
DOGGETT,Yeah. It's Knowle Rohrer.,4
SCULLY,Thank you. Thank you.,4
REYES,"I have to say with everything I know you must be feeling you look amazingly beautiful, Dana.",17
SCULLY,"And what about what you're feeling? Any vibrations, Agent Reyes?",10
REYES,I don't know.,3
SCULLY,What?,1
REYES,I don't know if I'm just being paranoid... …but something feels off.,12
REYES,We need some more water.,5
REYES,"Go back inside, Dana.",4
SCULLY,Who is it?,3
REYES,"Dana, it's okay. He's dead.",5
SCULLY,"No, it's not okay. What do you mean?",8
REYES,Exactly what I said. Now go on inside. We'll take care of this.,13
SCULLY,They said that he couldn't be stopped!,7
REYES,"Dana, he's got no vitals. He's lost too much blood.",10
GAME WARDEN,Is this the man you're afraid of? How did he find you out here? I do have to report this thing.,21
SCULLY,"No, you can't do that.",5
GAME WARDEN,I don't have any real choice.,6
SCULLY,"No, I mean, I, um... I just felt a contraction.",10
DOGGETT,Something's happening.,2
DOGGETT,Where's he going?,3
MULDER,"Not to see you, that's for sure.",7
DOGGETT,Who the hell's he going to see?,7
MULDER,You go ahead. I got Krycek.,6
SKINNER,Agent Doggett?,2
DOGGETT,What are you doing here?,5
SKINNER,They let me out of the hospital tonight. What are you doing here?,13
DOGGETT,I got Mulder down in the parking garage watching Alex Krycek.,11
SKINNER,What the hell is Krycek doing here?,7
DOGGETT,That's what I'm trying to figure out.,7
MULDER,Yeah?,1
DOGGETT,He's here with Agent Crane.,5
MULDER,Agent Crane? How the hell does he know Agent Crane?,10
DOGGETT,That's a damn good question. He doesn't.,7
MULDER,"You been wondering who's getting these guys past security, how Billy Miles is in the FBI? Agent Crane is in on this with your friend, which means he's in on it with Krycek. They've been in on it all along.",40
DOGGETT,I don't understand. In on what?,6
MULDER,"Fooling us, Agent Doggett. Into chasing after Billy Miles. Into believing that we could protect her.",16
DOGGETT,Scully?,1
MULDER,"Yes, they know where she is.",6
DOGGETT,"No, no, no. Only I know where she is.",9
MULDER,"You and Agent Reyes. You called her from a phone inside the FBI, didn't you?",15
SKINNER,"There's no way Crane can tap calls in here, Mulder. He'd have to have access to the communications system.",19
DOGGETT,Skinner's here with me.,4
MULDER,"Maybe this goes even higher. Listen to me, I've got to get to Scully. You've got to tell me where she is, where you sent her.",26
DOGGETT,"Look. We can nail these guys here, Mulder. We can put an end to it.",15
MULDER,"No, you listen. You've got to get out of there. You've got no guarantee these guys aren't alien replacements, too.",20
DOGGETT,Northern Georgia. A place called Democrat Hot Springs.,8
DOGGETT,Mulder!,1
KRYCEK,Get out of the car.,5
KRYCEK,Doesn't seem fair now. Doesn't seem right. Coming down to this.,11
MULDER,"What do you know about fair or right, Krycek? You're a coward.",12
KRYCEK,"I could've killed you so many times, Mulder. You've got to know that. I'm the one that kept you alive. Praying you'd win somehow.",24
MULDER,Then there really is no God.,6
KRYCEK,"You think I'm bad. That I'm a killer. We wanted the same thing, brother. That's what you don't understand.",19
MULDER,I wanted to stop them. All you wanted was to save your own ass.,14
KRYCEK,No. I tried to stop them. Tried to kill … Scully's baby to stop them. It's too late. The tragedy's that you-- you wouldn't let it go. That's why I have to do this. 'Cause you know how deep it goes. Right into the FBI.,45
MULDER,"You want to kill me, Alex, kill me. Like you killed my father. Just don't insult me trying to make me understand.",22
KRYCEK,It's going to take more bullets than you can... ever fire to win this game. But one bullet... and I can give you a thousand lives.,26
KRYCEK,Shoot Mulder.,2
MULDER,I'm going to go to the airport. I need that location from Agent Doggett.,14
MULDER,"Skinner, are you with me?",5
SKINNER,You just go. I'll get him.,6
GAME WARDEN,They're two minutes apart now. It's not going to be long.,11
REYES,How's this?,2
SCULLY,That's great.,2
DOGGETT,Right there! Both of you!,5
DOGGETT,I'm prepared to use force!,5
SKINNER,Come on! Agent Doggett... come on!,6
REYES,Here you go.,3
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
REYES,Move!,1
SCULLY,Agent Reyes... what?,3
REYES,Move out of here!,4
SCULLY,What's happening?,2
REYES,Who are you?!,3
GAME WARDEN,This baby will be born.,5
SCULLY,Agent Reyes!,2
SKINNER,The Blazer!,2
SKINNER,Get Mulder on the phone!,5
SCULLY,What's happening?! What?,3
REYES,"It's okay, Dana.",3
SCULLY,What... What...,2
REYES,It's going to be okay.,5
SCULLY,No!,1
SKINNER,Get him off!,3
SCULLY,This is my baby!,4
REYES,"You've got to push, Dana.",5
SCULLY,Please don't let them take it!,6
REYES,"Come on, Dana. Push!",4
SCULLY,Please don't let this happen.,5
REYES,"Dana, push!",2
SCULLY,It's mine!,2
SKINNER,Hold on!,2
REYES,"Harder! Push, Dana!",3
REYES,"Keep breathing, Dana. Keep breathing.",5
SCULLY,Please don't let them take it!,6
REYES,"Push! Push. Push, Dana, push!",5
MULDER,Down there. Get me down there.,6
MULDER,Hey! Scully! Scully! Where is she?! Scully! Where is she?! Scully! Where is she? Tell me where she is!,19
REYES,Mulder!,1
MULDER,How is she?,3
REYES,She's inside. She needs to get to the hospital.,9
KERSH,I'm to take this story seriously? These incidents at the FBI. This account of Agent Scully's birth. I'm to submit this report as quality investigative work? As representative of actual fact?,31
DOGGETT,"I signed the report there, sir.",6
KERSH,"Yeah, I see it, John. And I see her signature here, too. On an X-File.",15
KERSH,"I'd like to know when you assigned yourself, Agent Reyes.",10
REYES,"Agent Doggett assigned me, sir.",5
KERSH,Agent Doggett cannot just assume the authority of this office.,10
DOGGETT,"I assume it because this office is under investigation. For the late-night meeting between you, Agent Crane, and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer.",24
REYES,Both men were presumed dead but are now missing. In actual fact.,12
KERSH,You investigate what I tell you.,6
DOGGETT,And you put me on the X-Files. That's what I'm investigating.,11
FROHIKE,Get some rest.,3
[CLOSED CAPTIONING,SCULLY: Yeah.],2
FROHIKE,We didn't hear you come in.,6
LANGLY,We were just dropping off gifts.,6
BYERS,We just wanted to...,4
MULDER,See it with your own eyes.,6
FROHIKE,"It's incredible, you know? You arriving in time to save Scully. Getting her to a hospital.",16
BYERS,We still don't know how you did it. Speaking with Agent Doggett he said they never reached you with specific coordinates.,21
MULDER,There was a light. I followed it.,7
LANGLY,Guess we got our next headline.,6
MULDER,How's everybody doing?,3
SCULLY,We're doing just fine.,4
MULDER,"Hey, now.",2
MULDER,None of that.,3
MULDER,Hi.,1
MULDER,What are you going to call him?,7
SCULLY,William.,1
SCULLY,After your father.,3
MULDER,"Well, I don't know. He's... he's got your coloring and your eyes. But he looks suspiciously like Assistant Director Skinner.",20
SCULLY,"I don't understand, Mulder-- they came to take him from us-- why they didn't.",14
MULDER,"I don't quite understand that either. Except that maybe he isn't what they thought he was. That doesn't make him any less of a miracle though, does it?",28
SCULLY,"From the moment I became pregnant, I feared the truth... about how... and why. And I know that you feared it, too.",22
MULDER,I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know.,13
SCULLY,Which is what?,3
