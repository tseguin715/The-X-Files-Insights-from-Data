RICHTER,We're not... who... we are. We're not... who we are. It goes no further than this. It stops right here... right now.,22
RICHTER,"Team Captain John Richter here. It's been a couple of frustrating months but after a great deal of stick-with-it-ness, we're very proud to report that as of a half-hour ago, we surpassed the previous record for drilling down into an ice sheet.",42
MAN,All right!,2
MULDER,"This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project. They were sent to Alaska by the government's Advanced Research Project Agency nearly a year ago to drill into the arctic ice. The samples they removed contained trapped gases, dust, chemicals... evidence that could reveal the structure of the earth's climate back to the dawn of man. Their work was a success, nearly completed. No reports or indications of problems of any kind until only a week later, this next transmission was received.",84
RICHTER,We're not... who... we are. We're not... who we are. It goes no further than this. It stops... right here... right now.,22
SCULLY,What happened up there?,4
MULDER,"So far nobody's been able to reach to reach the compound because of bad weather. Obviously, they either think we're either brilliant or expendable because we've pulled the assignment.",29
SCULLY,Is it severe isolation distress?,5
MULDER,"These were top geophysicists. They were trained and screened for this project in every way imaginable, including psychological makeup. We leave for Nome today. We'll meet with three scientists familiar with the ice core project then head north up to the Icy Cape. The National Weather Service reports a three-day window to get in and out before the next arctic storm. Bring your mittens.",64
RADIO ANNOUNCER,Fouts looks over the Raiders' defense... here's the snap. Raiders blitz! Fouts dumps it across the middle to Winslow! He's at the 15! The 10! Touchdown San Diego!,28
MURPHY,Touchdown! Fouts... is... God! Sorry. My team scored.,8
SCULLY,There's no football on Wednesday.,5
MULDER,"Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?",6
MURPHY,"No, this is just some of my all-time favorite plays on tape. You two F.B.I.?",15
MULDER,"Agent Mulder and Agent Scully, you?",6
MURPHY,"Danny Murphy, professor of geology at U. C. San Diego.",10
MULDER,San Diego? You get much of a chance to study ice down there?,13
MURPHY,Just what's around the keg.,5
SCULLY,"Dr. DaSilva, Dr. Hodge?",4
HODGE,"Yeah, sorry we're late.",4
SCULLY,"Hi, Agent Mulder, Agent Scully...",5
MULDER,"Mulder, nice to meet you.",5
HODGE,"How're you doing, Mister Mulder?",5
MULDER,Hi.,1
HODGE,Can I see some identification?,5
MULDER,What for?,2
HODGE,I just want to make sure we are who we say we are. That's me.,15
MURPHY,That's you. It's me.,4
HODGE,It's you.,2
MULDER,It's me!,2
HODGE,Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.,5
MULDER,It's you.,2
HODGE,"Well, now that we know who we are, anybody care to take a guess as to why we're going?",19
MURPHY,"Well, two federal agents, a geologist, a medical doctor and a toxicologist. That should give us some idea what they're thinking.",21
SCULLY,I assume you all took a look at the tape.,10
MULDER,Something wrong?,2
DASILVA,"Come on, you're F.B.I. You have to know more than we do.",12
BEAR,You folks the ones going up to Icy Cape?,9
MULDER,Yeah.,1
BEAR,"Then I'm the one flying you. My name's Bear. The plane's across the way, provisions are loaded. Grab your gear.",20
HODGE,"Oh, could we see some credentials?",6
BEAR,Credentials. The only credentials that I have is that I'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there. You don't like those credentials... walk.,25
MULDER,Bear? See if you can get the power started.,9
BEAR,Anything to get out of here.,6
SCULLY,Where do we start?,4
HODGE,Body bags are on the plane.,6
MULDER,"Before we touch anything, we have to thoroughly document the scene.",11
SCULLY,Flashing.,1
MULDER,That's what they were drilling for. Quarter of a million years melting away in a couple of days.,18
MURPHY,I want to preserve some samples.,6
MULDER,It's the generator.,3
DASILVA,Oh. Agent Mulder! Look out!,5
BEAR,Hold on.,2
HODGE,Hold it down!,3
SCULLY,You okay?,2
MULDER,"Yeah, he didn't break the skin. Bear, you okay?",9
BEAR,He got me.,3
HODGE,Take that jacket off.,4
BEAR,"Just give me the stuff, I'll do it myself.",9
DASILVA,Is it rabies?,3
HODGE,"I don't see any indication of glodal spasm or tetany. If it is rabies, it's certainly not a strain I'm familiar with.",22
SCULLY,Look at this. Black nodules. Swollen lymph nodes.,8
DASILVA,Symptoms of the bubonic plague.,5
HODGE,"I'll do a blood test, we'll take it from that.",10
SCULLY,This dog has got a skin irritation on it's neck.,10
MURPHY,It looks like it's been scratching off it's own hair.,10
SCULLY,"Look at this, look at this!",6
MURPHY,What the hell was that?,5
SCULLY,"From the autopsies, it's clear that these men killed each other. There are contusions around the throat areas of three men, evidence of strangulation. Richter and Campbell killed themselves. I also found tissue damage due to fever.",37
BEAR,Did any of them have the black spots that the dog had?,12
SCULLY,No. None of them had the black nodules.,8
BEAR,"So, uh, those spots didn't have anything to do with those guys killing each other, right?",16
HODGE,I wouldn't rule it out. I just reexamined the dog. The nodules are gone.,14
MULDER,What could that mean?,4
HODGE,"Well, it could mean that the spots are a symptom of some disease at an early stage.",17
MULDER,Danny? Danny.,2
MURPHY,"Sorry. The play-off game against Miami, '82. Helps to get my mind off stuff.",14
MULDER,My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty.,11
MURPHY,"Alright, this is the Icy Cape area. It approximates the depth of the ice sheet to be about 3,000 meters thick.",21
MULDER,"I also found this data and if I'm reading it correctly, the team actually found the ice sheet to be twice that depth.",23
MURPHY,That's very good. The numbers indicate the topography to be concave. Looks like they were drilling inside a meteor crater.,20
HODGE,"No, you're wrong. That's impossible.",5
SCULLY,I analyzed two samples.,4
MULDER,What'd you find?,3
SCULLY,There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter's blood sample.,13
HODGE,It's not possible. Ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature.,10
DASILVA,I checked all the air filtration systems. I found no evidence of any such toxins.,15
MURPHY,"I have. In the ice. And that's not all there is. I found a high ratio of ammonia to water in the ice core. The earth's atmosphere could never have produced such high levels, not even a quarter of a million years ago. Look in the scope.",47
MULDER,Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment.,9
MURPHY,Tell me that's not a foreign object.,7
MULDER,Holy... Scully.,2
SCULLY,That same thing is in Richter's blood. What if that single-celled organism is the larval stage of a larger animal?,20
HODGE,"That's kind of a leap, don't you think?",8
SCULLY,The evidence is there.,4
MURPHY,Maybe the organism in the ice core somehow got into the men.,12
DASILVA,"Come on, nothing can survive in sub-zero temperatures for a quarter of a million years.",15
MULDER,Unless that's how it lives.,5
BEAR,"Look-it, I don't see why you're squabbling over some bug. You said it yourself, Scully, your autopsy found those men killed each other. That's it. Now I say, let's just get the hell out of here.",36
HODGE,"I agree. We can have the bodies sent to a facility where they can make a definitive diagnosis in the event that something was missed, Agent Scully.",27
MULDER,"If those bodies are infected with an unknown organism, we can't take them back. We can't go back without proper quarantine procedures. We can't risk bringing back the next plague.",30
BEAR,"Let's say you're right, they came down with something. We haven't and I ain't waiting around until we do.",19
HODGE,I think it's safe to go back. There's no reason why we'd be infected. We've taken all the necessary biological safeguards.,21
DASILVA,The dog did bite Bear.,5
BEAR,It jumped Mulder too!,4
MULDER,It didn't break the skin -,5
SCULLY,"Hey, look, there's only one way to proceed. A good doctor eliminates every possibility. We must determine if any of us is infected.",23
HODGE,"Alright, parasitic diagnostic procedure requires that each of us provide a blood and a stool sample.",16
BEAR,A stool sample?,3
MURPHY,"Well, this kind of travel always makes that kind of tough... for me.",13
MULDER,"Okay, anyone got the morning sports section handy?",8
BEAR,"I ain't dropping my cargo for no one. What I'm doing is getting my gear, getting my plane and flying the hell out of here.",25
MULDER,"You can't go, the dog bit you.",7
BEAR,I got hired to fly you up here and fly you back. No one said this might be part of the deal. So the deal is over.,27
SCULLY,We can't let him leave without him being checked.,9
DASILVA,Who's going to stop him?,5
MULDER,We have to. We can't risk infecting the population.,9
DASILVA,"He gets on that plane, I'm gonna be on it with him.",12
SCULLY,"Well, we don't have time to argue about it.",9
MULDER,"Take a vote. Whoever believes we should confine Bear until he agrees to an examination? All right. Bear, we just want to check you out. If we don't find any trace of the parasite or the virus, we'll all go.",40
BEAR,"All right, give me the damn jar.",7
MULDER,"Murphy, get a rope!",4
MURPHY,Right. Here!,2
DASILVA,Oh my God... oh!,4
HODGE,Get my bag!,3
SCULLY,What are you gonna do?,5
HODGE,"Scalpel, I'm cutting it out.",5
MULDER,We don't know enough about it!,6
HODGE,"It's killing him! Scully, help me hold the skin. Hold still, Bear! Forceps! Hold still, Bear, just another second. You're gonna be okay.",23
MULDER,"This is the A.I.C.P. Investigative Team calling Doolittle Airfield, come in.",11
RADIO,D.A.F. responding.,2
MULDER,"This is Agent Mulder, we have a serious biological hazard. Request air pick-up and quarantine procedures, over. Come in, Doolittle Airfield.",21
RADIO,"We copy, Agent Mulder. This area is under a heavy storm and no aircraft can get out for the next day. Maybe the military base in Kotzebue can set up a quarantine. Advise immediate evacuation, the arctic storm is bearing in your direction, over.",44
MULDER,"We were told we would have three clear days of weather, over.",12
RADIO,"Welcome to the top of the world, Agent Mulder. Over.",10
MULDER,"Is Bear in any condition to fly? We don't get out in an hour, we don't get out for days.",20
SCULLY,He's dead.,2
HODGE,"Well, it's similar to a tapeworm in that it has a scolex with suckers and hooks.",16
MURPHY,So then it's familiar? Something you can deal with?,9
DASILVA,What?,1
HODGE,"No. Very different from any organism, at least that I know of.",12
MULDER,Have you figured out how it's transmitted yet?,8
HODGE,"Exchange of fluids, touch, air, all of the above? I don't know.",12
SCULLY,All of the other dead bodies had the creature. This is the only one that's still alive.,17
MULDER,Were they all in the spine?,6
SCULLY,No. It appears that they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain.,14
MURPHY,Hypothalamus... what was that again?,5
SCULLY,It's a gland that secretes hormones although I don't know why a parasite would want to attach to it.,19
HODGE,"Hypothalamus releases acetlycholine, which produces violent, aggresive behavior. That might be a connection. Everybody that's been infected certainly seems to act aggresively. Maybe the worm feeds on the acetlycholine which floods our capacity to control violent behavior.",37
SCULLY,"Well, a parasite shouldn't want to kill it's host.",9
HODGE,It doesn't kill you until it's extracted. Then it releases a poison.,12
MULDER,"You're saying it's possible that the worm makes you want to kill other people, which is maybe what happened to the first team.",23
DASILVA,Or what could happen to us.,6
HODGE,"Well, it's just a theory. We don't have any definite proof.",11
MURPHY,Except five dead men.,4
SCULLY,If the worm makes people violently aggresive then why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves?,15
MULDER,Maybe they did it to save us.,7
SCULLY,"I'm just, uh... double-checking. Making sure I didn't miss anything.",10
MULDER,"Just some sleep, huh?",4
SCULLY,Sleep. I'm so tired I can't sleep.,7
MULDER,"We're all wired and hypersensitive, it'll be good to get a fresh start in the morning.",16
SCULLY,"Mulder, I don't want to waste a second trying to find a way to kill this thing.",17
MULDER,I don't know if we should kill it. This area of the ice sheet was formed over a meteor crater. The worm lived in ammonia. It survived sub-zero temperatures. Theorists in alternative life-designs believe in ammonia-supported life systems on planets with freezing temperatures.,43
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,The meteor that crashed here a quarter of a million years ago may have carried that type of life to earth.,21
SCULLY,"Mulder, that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes. Within a few hours, that parasite had total control. What would happen if this got into the population? A city the size of New York could be infected within a few days.",42
MULDER,Exactly. But what do we know about it? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater.,17
SCULLY,"Mulder, if we don't kill it now, we run the risk of becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads.",21
MULDER,"But if we do kill it now, we may never know how to stop it or anything like it in the future.",22
SCULLY,"Future? Mulder, how can you talk about the future when right now, there's......or anyone has the right to?",18
MULDER,Do we have the right to destroy an organism which can provide...,12
DASILVA,Tell me it's hot in here.,6
HODGE,"Don't worry, you don't have a fever. The heating system's malfunctioning. Outside, it's forty below and in here we're sweltering.",20
DASILVA,Can you hear what they're arguing about?,7
HODGE,They're probably discussing their little government secrets.,7
DASILVA,You think they knew it was up here before we arrived?,11
HODGE,I'm sure of it.,4
SCULLY,...about them posing a biological hazard!,6
HODGE,"You know, Bear's infected blood did get on Scully.",9
DASILVA,It also got on you.,5
MULDER,How do you know it can't be contained?,8
SCULLY,"It can! By extermination, we should take those bodies, worms and all, outside and incinerate them!",16
HODGE,"Something going on we should know about? Agent Scully, you all right?",12
SCULLY,"Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.",5
HODGE,You seem a little bit stressed out.,7
SCULLY,What the hell are you trying to say?,8
MULDER,"Let's all just settle down, it's been a long hard day. We're all tired and scared. Let's not all turn on one another.",23
HODGE,At least not without a good reason.,7
MULDER,Maybe we should all get some sleep.,7
HODGE,"You kidding? You think any of us could sleep right now? Guys, let's face it, we've got to check for spots. Any person or persons who has them should be confined. Are we agreed on that?",36
DASILVA,Are you going to do the exams?,7
SCULLY,No. We do them in front of each other. No secrets.,11
MULDER,"Before anyone passes judgement, may I remind you we are in the Arctic.",13
HODGE,"Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.",7
DASILVA,"Yeah, good night.",3
SCULLY,"Good night, Mulder.",3
MULDER,"Good night, Scully.",3
SCULLY,At least everyone's okay.,4
MULDER,"Don't forget, the spots on the dog went away.",9
RADIO ANNOUNCER,"...at the three yard line with fourth and goal and only fifteen seconds left in the game. Fouts goes over the ball, he snaps! He goes right... Mulder - attacked by dog Scully - exposed to infected blood Murphy - exposed to liquified ice core"" He eyes the door. DaSilva rolls over in bed, almost crying. Mulder puts his gun down on the dresser and looks at the door. Later, with the lights out, Mulder wakes with a startle. He immediately checks his gun. He looks for his shoes and hears a door close. He puts on his shoes and shirt, takes his gun and flashlight and sees that Murphy's door is open. Looking in, he sees no one. The walkman is on the bed. He goes into the lab, walking around. He is startled by the dog, which growls at him. He spins around, gun aimed, until he realizes it's the dog. He goes over to the desk, then looks at the freezer. Blood drips out under the door and onto the floor. He opens the door and Murphy falls out onto him, neck slit wide open and covered with blood. Scully, DaSilva and Hodge walk in.)",195
SCULLY,"Mulder, what are you doing?",5
MULDER,Murphy's dead.,2
HODGE,You killed him.,3
MULDER,"I found him like this. I heard one of the doors close, I came out to check it out. It's one of you.",23
HODGE,He's lying.,2
DASILVA,You could have done it and not even known.,9
SCULLY,"No, he said he didn't do it.",7
MULDER,I don't have any of the symptoms.,7
SCULLY,"You checked him yourself, Hodge.",5
HODGE,"Yeah, six hours ago.",4
MULDER,It was one of you!,5
SCULLY,"Stop it! Just stop it, shut up! Mulder, just put the gun down and let Hodge give you a blood test.",21
MULDER,"What, so he can doctor the results? I'm not gonna let him stick a needle in me! He could be infected!",21
HODGE,He has to be confined now!,6
SCULLY,Then just turn around and let us take a look at your neck!,13
MULDER,"I'm not turning my back on anyone! As far as I'm concerned, you're all infected!",15
DASILVA,"Hodge is right, we oughta lock him up!",8
SCULLY,Mulder!,1
MULDER,"Scully, get that gun off me!",6
SCULLY,"Mulder, you have to understand!",5
MULDER,Put it down!,3
SCULLY,You put it down first!,5
MULDER,"Scully! For God sakes, it's me!",6
SCULLY,Mulder... you may not be who you are.,8
MULDER,"In here, I'll be safer than you.",7
HODGE,What were you doing?,4
SCULLY,You know what I was doing.,6
HODGE,"You know, I can't help thinking, Agent Scully, that you're the only one with a gun. If you get infected, we don't stand a chance, do we?",27
DASILVA,Was there something there?,4
HODGE,"You're okay, Nancy. We're all okay. Now is not the time for the three of us to break down and turn on each other.",24
SCULLY,There's four of us.,4
HODGE,Mulder isn't one of us anymore.,6
SCULLY,"If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault! We can't turn our backs on him now, he needs us to help him!",22
DASILVA,She's right. Who knows what prolonged exposure to the parasite could do to him? It could damage him to the point of permanent psychosis.,24
HODGE,"But if he is infected, he doesn't go back! I won't risk the possibilities!",14
SCULLY,"This is A.I.C.P. calling Doolittle Airfield, please come in. This is the Arctic Ice Core Project sending a general distress call, please respond!",23
HODGE,"Nanc, you wanna put a drop of the uninfected blood on the slide of the blood drawn from the pilot?",20
DASILVA,Run that by me again.,5
HODGE,"Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood. No, damn it! What did I just get through telling you? You just infected already infected blood, now we have to start all over again.",33
DASILVA,"I made a mistake, you don't have to yell at me.",11
HODGE,Wasted hours of work...,4
DASILVA,"Well okay, well then maybe you could just do it by yourself! Damn it! God, I'm not your assistant!",19
HODGE,"Oh, get out of here...",5
DASILVA,All you do is just...,5
SCULLY,Hodge.,1
HODGE,What?,1
SCULLY,Come take a look at this. The larvae from two different worms killed each other. An individual worm will not tolerate another invading it's host. It does to the invader what it did to humans. It makes them kill.,39
HODGE,"It doesn't make sense for a species to kill it's own, it needs another to procreate.",16
DASILVA,Worms are hermaphroditic. It can reproduce itself.,7
SCULLY,Look at the evidence in the microscope. This thing does not like company.,13
HODGE,So what are you saying? The way to kill it is to introduce another worm into the already infected body? Sounds okay. It passed the worms in it's stool. They're dead.,31
SCULLY,I want to talk to him first. Try to make this voluntary.,12
DASILVA,What?,1
HODGE,You can't go in alone.,5
SCULLY,"If anything happens, you come inside. I can't do this to him until I'm sure.",15
MULDER,It's just you?,3
SCULLY,Yes.,1
MULDER,It's one of them.,4
SCULLY,No one's been killed since you've been in here.,9
MULDER,So?,1
SCULLY,We found a way to kill it. Two worms in one host will kill each other.,16
MULDER,"You give me one worm, you'll infect me.",8
SCULLY,"If that's true, then why didn't you let us inspect you?",11
MULDER,I would have but you pulled a gun on me. Now I don't trust them. I wanted to trust you.,20
SCULLY,Okay. But now they're not here.,6
DASILVA,This is the last one. She's not going to let us give it to him.,15
HODGE,"Well, she'll have to if he's infected.",7
DASILVA,He'll convince her somehow.,4
SCULLY,I just examined him. He's... uninfected.,6
MULDER,So is she.,3
SCULLY,Which means that it must be one of you.,9
HODGE,All right. Go over to the main building. I'd like to check him myself. Then he can examine both of us. Wanna lead the way? Get the worm!,28
MULDER,Bastards! No! Ah! Stop... no!,5
HODGE,Oh my God! Mulder! It's her!,6
MULDER,Scully! It's DaSilva!,3
SCULLY,"Hodge! Now! Mulder! After this, there won't be any left!",10
MULDER,Do it!,2
DASILVA,Nooooo! No! No!,3
SCULLY,It's all right. It's all over. It all stops right here. Right now.,13
HODGE,"She's being put in quarantine along with the dog. We'll keep her there until we're sure she won't infect the rest of the population. Meanwhile, our tests came back normal so we've been released. Plane ready. Take you as far from the ice as you want to go.",48
MULDER,"I'm going back to the site. This time, I'm going fully prepared with proper equipment. There's still a lot of research to be done on it's genetic structure, on it's origin...",31
HODGE,"Wait, Mulder. Don't you know?",5
MULDER,Know what?,2
HODGE,"45 minutes after they evacuated us, they torched the place. There's nothing left.",13
SCULLY,Who did that?,3
HODGE,"The military, centers for disease control... you oughta know. They're your people.",12
MULDER,"It's still there, Scully. 200,000 years down in the ice.",10
SCULLY,Leave it there.,3
