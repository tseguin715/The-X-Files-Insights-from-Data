MR. BURT,"Bartender? Seven and seven, pack of Morleys.",7
WAYNE,"Seven and seven, pack of Morleys.",6
MR. BURT,We have a winner!,4
WAYNE,Do I know you?,4
MR. BURT,"Do you know me? Come on, Wayne-O. I'm part of the regular game? You know your problem, my friend? It's not the cards. It's playing the hand you were dealt. Well, you guys get a bad deal, it's all in what you do with it. You know what I'm saying, pardner? You can think. Cards can't. they just lie there. You gotta make them work for you. Jack of Hearts. Two million, five hundred and ninety-eight thousand, nine hundred and sixty possible five card hands. Twelve hundred and seventy-seven flushes, and then you got your suit. One million, ninety-eight thousand, two hundred and forty ways to make two pairs. And yet, the game can't beat the man. Man only beats himself. And so on and so forth.",127
MR. BURT,She comes here every Friday. Loses her paycheck. Cries all weekend. Such a nice girl. I keep hoping her luck is gonna change and she could catch a break.,29
MR. BURT,We gonna blow this joint? Call it a night?,9
MR. BURT,"I know, you're bluffing me, right? You're gonna show me Fifth Street. Walk right out of here, surprise me, for a change.",22
MR. BURT,Three of hearts. Two of clubs.,6

WOMAN,"Oh, my god! Help me, please!! Help me!! Somebody help me! There's a woman who's been murdered! Somebody help me! Oh, god!! She's been murdered! Help!",26
TAGLINE,DIO TI AMA,3
SCULLY,Agent Reyes?,2
REYES,Three plus four is seven. Seven and six are thirteen.,10
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
REYES,"Ten, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen. I want to ask you to open your mind to something. I don't want you to think I'm crazy, all right?",25
SCULLY,Why would I think that you're crazy?,7
REYES,"Do you believe the universe is knowable as a mathematical calculation of the whole, reducible to a single equation?",19
SCULLY,No.,1
REYES,Why not?,2
SCULLY,Because I don't think that its complexity allows for it to be reduced so simply.,15
REYES,But you accept that some people do?,7
SCULLY,"I presume you mean the so-called Unified Theory, what physicists often refer to as the theory of everything. An equation so simple they say that it might be printed on a T-shirt. It's a holy grail in the world of science. Potentially the most important question that mankind has ever asked. But that such a complex calculation is even possible is a subject of enormous controversy. Is that what you mean?",71
REYES,Uh... potentially.,2
REYES,"Carla Maria Carpenter, born two, one, seventy-seven. Killed outside a nightclub two years ago. Her murder remains unsolved. Judy Ann Fuller, born three, twenty-one, sixty-nine, killed at a mall two years ago, unsolved. Julie Frances Gresham, born one, twenty-two, eighty, killed in her parked car last month, unsolved.",48
SCULLY,"Agent Reyes, if there's a connection that I'm supposed to be seeing, I'm not seeing it.",16
REYES,"And our latest victim, Amy Sheridan Noffsberger, born four, four, seventy-seven, killed two weeks ago in a casino. Police have yet to find her killer.",25
SCULLY,"Agent Reyes, am I to presume that you've solved these unsolved murders by using some kind of numerical calculation?",19
REYES,"Letters of names assigned values, added to birth dates, reduced to the lowest common denominator. A-J-S equal one. B-K-T...",19
SCULLY,"Numerology, Agent Reyes... You're trying to solve these cases by using what is essentially a child's game.",17
REYES,"It's been in use since the Sixth Century B.C., when Pythagoras determined that the world was built on the power and influence of numbers.",24
SCULLY,"And, uh, when exactly did you stumble upon it?",9
REYES,"We did it as kids. I still do it. You meet people at a party, ask them their birth date. It's kind of an ice breaker. And as I was reading the story of this woman, I calculated she was a fourteen. What they call a karmic number. An extremely significant numerological number, prompting me to look at all these other unsolved cases. The victims of which also work out to have karmic numbers. Ten, thirteen, sixteen.",77
SCULLY,"So in other words, you haven't actually solved these cases.",10
REYES,"Maybe ""cracked"" is a better word.",6
SCULLY,"Without any other evidence to directly connect them, circumstantial or forensic.",11
REYES,What?,1
SCULLY,Can you enlarge this? Can I see the rest of those photos?,12
REYES,What is it?,3
SCULLY,There's a pattern in the bruising. All four of the victims have it. Three small circles. It might be from a ring that the killer wears.,26
REYES,"So you're saying these cases are connected? That numerology may actually be driving the killer, and that I'm definitely not crazy?",21
SCULLY,Or that maybe you're both crazy.,6

OLD ITALIAN MAN,E' veramente speciale!,3
MR. BURT,nan,1
OLD ITALIAN MAN #2,Mamma mia!,2
OLD ITALIAN MAN #1,Ma come fa?,3
OLD ITALIAN MAN #2,"Vabbuò io me ne vaco, tanto cu vuie è inutile... nun c'è sfizio",13
MR. BURT,Arrivederci.,1
MR. BURT,Wayne-O! Come stai?,3
WAYNE,"Quit following me, or you might find yourself dead real soon.",11
MR. BURT,"Oh, come on, Wayne-O. That's not your style. Doesn't fit your pattern. Far be it for me to rat you out. Can't show 'em what they can't see. Now, two clowns, and a man with a crown. You want to try your luck, sailor? King runs, but he can't hide. How can you lose? Kids stuff. There goes the neighbourhood. Pop Mr. Bunny right next-door. You know, there's a secret to this game, Wayne-O. And I'm gonna tell you what the secret is. Choose better.",85
WAYNE,"You got somethin' to say to me, you say it.",10
MR. BURT,"Son, I just did.",4
REYES,Hello?,1
BURDICK,"Uh, there's a clipboard over there, uh, with three forms. Only fill out the top one, or all three if you want to unlock your most secret numbers to love, life and true personal happiness.",35
REYES,"I'm not here for a personal chart. I'm with the FBI, investigating a series of deaths that seem to have a numerological connection.",23
BURDICK,I give valuable insights to the living. The dead pretty much already know their future.,15
REYES,"Well, these are murders. I'm looking for your help in trying to solve them.",14
BURDICK,You may over estimate the kind of work I'm capable of here.,12
REYES,My hope is in doing the victim's complete numerology you'll be able to draw a picture of the killer.,19
BURDICK,"I don't think you understand. I run a little business here. Uh, people come to me, they want to improve their lives, how to get rich, how to marry the man of their dreams. I mean, look around. If I could actually provide that kind of information? I don't have to draw you a picture.",55
REYES,You don't believe in it?,5
BURDICK,"At best, it's an art.",5
REYES,"I have established an undeniable numerological connection between the victims in all of these cases. If I found the killer, I might prevent this happening again.",26
BURDICK,Let me see what I can come up with.,9
REYES,Monica Reyes.,2
DOGGETT,"Monica? You're not gonna believe this. We found two more cases. Two more victims to add to this thing. Both with the same marks on their faces. Now I knew you were good, but this? This is career launching. You'd better get back here.",44
DOGGETT,Nice work.,2
FBI AGENT,Well done. Well done.,4
REYES,Thank you.,2
FBI AGENT,"By brilliantly tying these murder cases together, VICAP is now working hard to develop a profile on the man we are officially calling the ""Triple Zero Killer"". Through the identification of a pattern he leaves on his victims, we have been able to connect six unsolved cases to one murderer, including these two new cases. Agent Scully will act as the point person on the case forensics. That's three recent killings, and three from 1999. The developing pattern now appears to be murders in threes, on a serpentine trail up across the eastern seaboard. Agent Doggett will lead the task force, and is ready to roll. Here's what we don't know. One: How he chooses his victims. Two: How the killer kills. And three: If he'll kill again soon, or disappear as he did two years ago.",137
DOGGETT,He may have been incarcerated during those years. We may be lookin' for someone with a record.,17
FBI AGENT,That's an excellent observation.,4
SCULLY,The killer is strong. He uses his fists as weapons. Brute force. He is angry and he acts on impulse.,20
FBI AGENT,"Good. Important. Agent Reyes, we're all working off your lead. Give us the benefit of your special insight into this case.",21
REYES,"Well, the killer probably has a soul number of either four or six. His birth path is, I'm guessing, a nine or maybe a six. The destiny and realization numbers are definitely karmic. I'll know for sure once I've got the charts from the numerologist, but the killer is almost certainly working off numerical vibrational disharmonies.",56
REYES,That's her now. Monica Reyes.,5
BURDICK,Agent Reyes?,2
BURDICK,I've been running numbers here on the murder victims.,9
BURDICK,And the strangest thing has come up.,7
REYES,What? What is it?,4
BURDICK,"Oh, there's three forms on the clipboard. Fill out the top one or all three if you want to unlock your most secret...",23
FBI AGENT,"I want her body sent to Quantico. I want facts, I want details. I want Agent Scully to go over this woman with a fine tooth comb.",27
DOGGETT,"Yes, Sir.",2
FBI AGENT,"And I want you, Agent Reyes, to tell me who else knows about this.",14
REYES,Knows about what?,3
FBI AGENT,About this case. About you coming to this office to see this woman.,13
REYES,I don't think I told anyone.,6
FBI AGENT,Then how did the killer find his way here? Chance? Coincidence?,11
REYES,"I, I...",2
FBI AGENT,"We've got a guy working the whole eastern seaboard, murdering up and down the coast. Tell me how it is he winds up here in this city in this building on this floor in this room, on the same day you came here to see her, if he didn't know?",50
REYES,"That's actually why I came to see this woman. To find out who the killer is, why he does what he does when he does it.",26
FBI AGENT,"We have a reputation to uphold, Agent Reyes. The FBI doesn't go to numerologists, for the same reason we don't consult horoscopes or palm readers or crystal balls. A killer kills for a reason. He lives in the world of cause and effect, as we all do. He gets an impulse and acts on it. Always the case, even if he doesn't know it. And that's how we catch him.",70
REYES,"If he acts on impulses he can't understand, isn't it possible we can't understand them either? Can we not accept that every killer is not driven by the same impulses, and that there are some impulses that not every killer kills for.",42
FBI AGENT,No.,1
REYES,Why not?,2
FBI AGENT,Because it's unacceptable.,3
DOGGETT,"But if Agent Reyes didn't tell anyone she was comin' here, the only person who would possibly have any idea is somebody at the FBI.",25
FBI AGENT,An inside job? I don't buy it.,7
DOGGETT,But don't we at least have to accept that as a possibility?,12
FBI AGENT,"No, we don't.",3
REYES,Why?,1
FBI AGENT,Because it's highly improbable.,4
DOGGETT,But not impossible.,3
FBI AGENT,"Six of one, half dozen of the other.",8
DOGGETT,"How would you like us to proceed, Sir?",8
FBI AGENT,"The bottom line is I want results. I don't care how you go about it. What I want is this killer caught. All right, let's get the body out of here.",31
DOGGETT,Maybe you were followed.,4
REYES,How? If the killer didn't even know I was looking for him?,12
DOGGETT,I don't know. You explain it then.,7
REYES,"This woman called me, just before she was murdered. She had something to tell me. Something she found in the victim's charts.",22
DOGGETT,Their charts?,2
REYES,"Their numerology. A calculation of numbers that rule their lives, in thirteen different categories.",14
DOGGETT,But a calculation based on what?,6
REYES,On names and birth dates.,5
DOGGETT,"And because my name is John J. Doggett, and I was born April Fourth, 1960, I got some kind of magic number?",22
REYES,"Six. Which makes you an active, adaptive, curious person, who insists on their independence, loves a bargain, and above all else, wants to be successful.",25
DOGGETT,"Well, that describes pretty much anyone.",6
REYES,People are people.,3
DOGGETT,Right. They're non-numbers.,3
REYES,Then what was she calling me for?,7
DOGGETT,I'm gonna leave you here to figure that out. I'm goin' back to the Bureau.,15
MR. BURT,nan,1
MR. BURT,Buongiorno. Wayne-O.,2
WAYNE,Who do you think you are?,6
MR. BURT,Who do you think I am?,6
WAYNE,Don't say a word.,4
MR. BURT,Do I ever?,3
WAYNE,You're just tryin' to get me caught.,7
MR. BURT,"I'm just playin' a game of dominoes. Long as you're sitting here, though, how you feelin'?",16
WAYNE,Go to hell.,3
MR. BURT,Are the reservations in your name? You're a card. You really are a card. But I love you. Got time for a quick game?,24
WAYNE,I don't play your games.,5
MR. BURT,Not a truer word's been spoken.,6
SCULLY,"The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick. Upon external examination, cause of death appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla, in which a small three-ring pattern lies. I will begin my internal examination at six-oh-six PM",37
REYES,Agent Scully.,2
SCULLY,I've got something to show you.,6
REYES,What is it?,3
SCULLY,"I figured out what the triple zero pattern on the victim is. They aren't zeroes at all. It's the number 6-6-6, only worn away. It must be stamped on the killer's ring. 6-6- 6, the work of the devil.",39
REYES,Of course. How'd you figure that?,6
SCULLY,I didn't.,2
REYES,Then how'd you discover it?,5
SCULLY,Completely by accident.,3
REYES,"I discovered something, too. The victim's charts. When the numbers were figured, the numerologist found they were a match to her own numbers.",23
SCULLY,Uh... And how did the killer find her?,8
REYES,It obviously wasn't an accident.,5
SCULLY,And how does that help us find the killer?,9
REYES,It doesn't.,2
FBI AGENT,Agent Doggett. I think we have a psychological profile on the murderer.,12
DOGGETT,What is it?,3
FBI AGENT,"Based on the amalgam of forensic detail, facts such as time and place the murders were committed and the amount of force used, we believe the killer is a man in his mid-20's to late 40's, of average build and looks, who is driven by a rage stemming from a hatred of his mother from a very early age. He was a bed wetter, who was made to feel inferior, which he took out on the world by killing small animals.",81
DOGGETT,That's it?,2
FBI AGENT,Go to work.,3
DOGGETT,That's the average profile of almost every single serial killer the FBI's ever hunted down.,15
FBI AGENT,"Is that really all that surprising? Is there a problem, Agent Doggett?",12
DOGGETT,It's the way Agent Reyes found the cases. I don't think she should so easily be dismissed.,17
FBI AGENT,You don't believe in this nonsense.,6
DOGGETT,Look at this. The path of the killer forms the number six.,12
FBI AGENT,Your point?,2
DOGGETT,I don't know. I just noticed it.,7
FBI AGENT,"Have you noticed all babies look like Winston Churchill? Same difference, Agent Doggett.",13
DOGGETT,What if this is the killer's pattern? What if the number six has some kind of significance to the murders?,20
FBI AGENT,It may. To you and Agent Reyes. But not to victim number seven.,13
REYES,"If I could analyse these numbers, I know we could figure this out.",13
SCULLY,"Despite what we know about the victim's numerology, about the ring that we think that he wears, we really know next to nothing about where to start looking for this man.",31
REYES,The answer's gonna come to me.,6
SCULLY,You going down?,3
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,Get out of the elevator!! Move!!,6
WAYNE,Just-Just be cool. Be cool. All right? Everything's gonna be fine. Be cool.,13
SCULLY,It's him.,2
REYES,It's going down.,3
SCULLY,Stairs.,1
REYES,It's not getting reception.,4
SCULLY,Great.,1
REYES,No service.,2
SCULLY,We have to get an APB out on that car. Did you happen to see a plate?,17
SCULLY,We've got all the numbers on this case except for the ones we need.,14
REYES,Maybe there's another way out.,5
SCULLY,Well it's only midnight. There's gotta be somebody coming in or out soon.,13
REYES,How do we know who was driving that car? That it was even him? That the killer's not still here.,20
SCULLY,"We're Federal Agents and we're armed! If you are here, and you make any sudden moves, we will be forced to consider you a threat.",25
SCULLY,Stay where you are! Right there!,6
REYES,"Hands where we can see them! Get out of the car, slowly.",12
MR. BURT,Did I do something wrong?,5
SCULLY,Step out around the back of the car.,8
SCULLY,I want you to show us some identification.,8
MR. BURT,I don't have a wallet.,5
REYES,Do you have some form of I.D.?,7
MR. BURT,I don't think so.,4
SCULLY,"Sir, what are you doing here?",6
MR. BURT,Waiting for a friend.,4
SCULLY,"At midnight, in a parking garage?",6
MR. BURT,We have this regular game we play.,7
REYES,What kind of game?,4
MR. BURT,Checkers. The checkers are... in the trunk... if either of you play.,12
SCULLY,"Sir, does it look like we're here to play checkers?",10
MR. BURT,What are you here for?,5
REYES,Get your hands back up in the air! Step forward. Put your hands on the trunk.,16
REYES,He's clean.,2
SCULLY,All right. Let's pop the trunk.,6
SCULLY,What's all this?,3
MR. BURT,Music.,1
REYES,You must really like music.,5
MR. BURT,"Oh, I love it. The classics, of course. Mozart, Bach, the earlier jazz, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra, Doo-Wap, Elvis, marching bands...",20
SCULLY,"Sir, enough.",2
MR. BURT,"Don't get me wrong. I love all music. But I prefer the stuff that lasts. Do you like them? Keep them. Thanks to the wondrous world of digital technology, I can always make more.",34
SCULLY,What time is your friend coming?,6
MR. BURT,Soon.,1
REYES,What do you want to do?,6
SCULLY,I don't know. I don't know.,6
MR. BURT,I have some nice dance music.,6
SCULLY,"We happen to be here, Sir, because there is a serial killer on the loose.",15
MR. BURT,How many did he kill?,5
REYES,Seven women now.,3
MR. BURT,How you gonna catch him?,5
SCULLY,"We're not, stuck down here.",5
MR. BURT,You sure there's nothing I can do?,7
SCULLY,Do you have the combination to the door?,8
MR. BURT,No...,1
REYES,Do you have a cell phone that works?,8
MR. BURT,I wish I did. There's always checkers.,7
MR. BURT,Next victim?,2
SCULLY,How did we get ourselves into this?,7
SCULLY,Agent Reyes?,2
REYES,Your hair colour.,3
SCULLY,I don't believe it.,4
MR. BURT,What?,1
REYES,What if we are his next victims?,7
MR. BURT,You?,1
REYES,The seventh victim was a blonde.,6
MR. BURT,But neither of you are blondes.,6
REYES,"He kills in threes. Blonde, redhead, brunette. The next victims will be a redhead and a brunette.",17
MR. BURT,Amazing... from a game of checkers.,6
SCULLY,Who are you?,3
MR. BURT,Obviously someone you were very lucky to have run into.,10
SCULLY,You're part of this.,4
MR. BURT,How do you figure that?,5
REYES,No. It's all in the numbers. It makes perfect sense. The numbers led us to the killer. The killer led us to the garage. And now all we've done is recognize the killer's real serial pattern.,36
MR. BURT,So you're saying I didn't have anything to do with it?,11
SCULLY,Keep your hands up.,4
MR. BURT,Why?,1
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MR. BURT,What's this about numbers?,4
SCULLY,Will you just...,3
MR. BURT,I'm very good with numbers.,5
REYES,The killer is driven by an impulse we believe is numerological.,11
MR. BURT,Of course. He's a serial killer.,6
SCULLY,"No, that's... that's not what she means. She thinks that his acts are determined by a calculation of numbers.",19
MR. BURT,So the killer is not in control of his actions - the numbers are.,13
MR. BURT,"Well, are the numbers helping you catch him, or are they helping him not get caught?",16
REYES,That's a good question.,4
MR. BURT,So... it's a kind of a game.,7
SCULLY,No. It's not.,3
REYES,"No, maybe it is. Maybe that's what this is about. Who wins the game.",14
MR. BURT,I think she's on to something.,6
SCULLY,Agent Reyes. You can't reduce a complex factor as physical and psychological into a game.,15
REYES,"You're a scientist, Agent Scully. Your world is ruled by numbers. Atoms, molecules, periodicity. MR. BURT Wow...",17
REYES,"And wouldn't it follow that everything made from those things is ruled by numbers, too? Genes, chromosomes, us, the Universe.",20
MR. BURT,"Go, girl.",2
SCULLY,"Agent Reyes, that is utter nonsense, okay? It would mean that all we are are checkers on a checker board being moved around by some... forces completely outside and unbeknownst to us.",32
REYES,What did Einstein say?,4
MR. BURT,Einstein. Now there's a winner.,5
REYES,God does not play dice with the universe.,8
SCULLY,"Nor does he play checkers. Look, Agent Reyes, you can't reduce all of life, all creation, every piece of... of art, architecture, music, literature... into a game of win or lose.",31
REYES,"Why not? Maybe the winners are those who play the game better. Those who see the patterns and the connections, like we're doing right now.",25
MR. BURT,Free will.,2
REYES,"Maybe we're not the next victims. Maybe we're here, because we saw the numbers, and read the patterns, and we're here to catch the killer.",25
SCULLY,"But the killer is outside, killing, and we are stuck in a parking garage.",14
REYES,What if he's not? What if we didn't look hard enough? What if the killer is still down here?,19
SCULLY,What are you lookin' at?,5
MR. BURT,The same thing you are.,5
MR. BURT,So what now?,3
SCULLY,You go left and I'll go right. You? You stay right where you are.,14
MR. BURT,"Oh, there's no getting rid of me.",7
SCULLY,He's going fast.,3
DOGGETT,Are you okay?,3
REYES,"Yeah, I think so.",4
SCULLY,Can you hear me?,4
REYES,Why'd you do it? Kill those women?,7
SCULLY,How did you ever find us?,6
DOGGETT,I saw somethin' in his pattern. Made me realize there was gonna be nine victims. And that maybe you two were gonna be eight and nine.,26
REYES,Where'd he go?,3
REYES,Hello?,1
SCULLY,All right. I need to know.,6
REYES,What?,1
SCULLY,What my numerology is. My number. Whatever you call it. What am I?,13
REYES,You're a nine.,3
SCULLY,Which means what?,3
REYES,Nine is completion. You've evolved through the experiences of all the other numbers to a spiritual realization that this life is only part of a larger whole.,27
REYES,"Dana, are you there?",4
SCULLY,There's something else that's buggin' me.,6
REYES,What's that?,2
SCULLY,Who was that man?,4
REYES,God knows.,2
