MAN #1,Precisely.,1
MAN #2,There's a piece chipped off.,5
MAN #1,By me.,2

FEMALE REPORTER,"...Shipworks, where a sixty-mile high speed car chase ended early this evening. The suspect eluded capture by leaping into the harbor but not before reportedly injuring several Ardis officers. We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by. Captain? How was the man able to escape and how seriously injured were the officers involved?",52
LACERIO,"Those details are still unclear, I'll be talking with several of the off...",13
MAN,"We need you, Captain.",4
LACERIO,"I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.",7
FEMALE REPORTER,Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense manhunt. Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense...,21
SCULLY,"Mulder, you've been through this tape a hundred times. What exactly are you hoping to find?",16
MULDER,I don't know.,3
SCULLY,And all he told you to was to watch channel eight?,11
MULDER,"Yeah, that's all he said.",5
SCULLY,Do we even know why the suspect was being chased?,10
MULDER,"As far as I can tell, he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.",14
SCULLY,"Well, that ought to put him in the Ten Most Wanted list.",12
MULDER,There's got to be something here. Some detail. Something we're not seeing.,12
SCULLY,"How do you know he's not just yanking your chain, this Deep Throat character?",14
MULDER,Why would he do that?,5
SCULLY,"Well, he has lied to you by his own admission.",10
MULDER,I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here... something I was supposed to see. Something he wants me to see.,22
SCULLY,Then what are you missing?,5
LACERIO,"Well, I don't know if you were aware but there were three different law enforcement agencies out here last night.",20
MULDER,Hunting a man on a moving violation?,7
LACERIO,"I know it's not ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but it's what we do.",13
MULDER,The man in the photograph doesn't appear to be wearing a badge or a uniform. He's not one of yours?,20
LACERIO,"No, sir. But like I said, it was a zoo out here.",12
MULDER,You say the suspect was shot. Any explanation why the body hasn't been recovered?,14
LACERIO,"Well, has you can see, we've got our search ongoing. Divers' down there in shifts. We're quite certain he'll be found.",21
MULDER,"It's been almost eighteen hours, Captain. Where could the body be?",11
LACERIO,"Well, there are cables and debris all over the bottom. It's a painstaking business. Can I ask what the F.B.I.'s interest in this case would be?",26
MULDER,The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive.,9
LACERIO,Really? How's that? No description of the suspect has been released.,11
MULDER,"If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please?",13
LACERIO,It's been taken to impound.,5
SCULLY,"The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg. They had no idea that the car was even missing. You know, Mulder, I think that we're wasting our time here.",35
MULDER,"I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find. You can't make out the license plate in this photo. Hey, Scully, look at this.",25
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,Look at the car in this photo. Look at the windshield.,11
SCULLY,It's not the same car.,5
SCULLY,It's called a caduceus. It's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession.,14
MULDER,"So, probably, only a doctor would have that on his car.",11
SCULLY,Mm-hmmm.,1
MULDER,"I had the picture enhanced and the plate is different. ""3-A-Y-F.""",11
SCULLY,Fast-forward.,1
MULDER,"That's all you can make out. The rest is obscured. Hey, Danny, it's Mulder. I need you to run a Maryland plate for me. All I got is a partial. Registered to a doctor. Or used to be. Yeah, I'll hold. They switched cars on us, Scully, and they lied about it.",52
SCULLY,Why would they do that?,5
MULDER,"Maybe the, uh, real owner of the car has got something to hide.",13
MULDER,Doctor Berube?,2
BERUBE,Yes?,1
MULDER,"We're with the F.B.I., can we have a minute of your time?",12
BERUBE,I'm actually very busy.,4
MULDER,I'm sorry. Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Arlis yesterday?,20
BERUBE,Excuse me?,2
MULDER,"A silver Ciera, doctor. Do you own a silver Ciera?",10
BERUBE,Yes. It was used for what?,6
MULDER,A crime. Were you aware that it was even missing?,10
BERUBE,Not until you mentioned it. I have a housekeeper and she often uses the car. It's a second car... Please! They should not be excited. Nothing should be touched.,29
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly.",7
BERUBE,They're part of an experiment.,5
MULDER,What kind of experiment?,4
BERUBE,Am I under some kind of suspicion?,7
MULDER,No.,1
BERUBE,"Then I think I've answered all your questions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more work than time.",19
MULDER,Thank you. Did he bite you?,6
SCULLY,"No, but he tried to.",5
MULDER,"Well, IT'S ALMOST 5:00. We should check with the doctor's housekeeper about the car while we're out here.",18
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,"""No?"" What do you mean, ""no?""",6
SCULLY,"I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder. We're out here on half a hunch off of a cryptic phone call chasing down a, a clue that's based on nothing but speculation.",34
MULDER,"Well, that's all we've got.",5
SCULLY,"That's all he's given us. Who is this Deep Throat character? I mean, we don't know anything about him. What his name is, what he does...",26
MULDER,He's in a delicate position. He has access to information and indiscretion could expose him.,15
SCULLY,You don't know that this isn't just a game with him. He's toying with you. Rationing out the facts.,19
MULDER,You think he does it because he gets off on it?,11
SCULLY,No. I think he does it because you do.,9
DEEP THROAT,"Calling it a night, Mister Mulder?",6
MULDER,My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on.,12
DEEP THROAT,I'm surprised at you.,4
MULDER,Why?,1
DEEP THROAT,Your level of commitment seems to have diminished.,8
MULDER,My level of commitment?,4
DEEP THROAT,I should have expected that you'd be working through the night trying to put the pieces together.,17
MULDER,"Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with.",11
DEEP THROAT,"Under the circumstances, I've given you all I can.",9
MULDER,A news report?,3
DEEP THROAT,And where has it led you?,6
MULDER,Not very far.,3
DEEP THROAT,It may be further than you realized.,7
MULDER,"You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms. I've gone along. Been the dutiful son. But maybe this time, we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble.",39
DEEP THROAT,I fear you've become to dependent on me.,8
MULDER,Let me tell you something. I've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic. Maybe it's you who's become too dependent on me... on my willingness to play your games.,39
DEEP THROAT,Mister Mulder?,2
MULDER,What?,1
DEEP THROAT,Don't give up on this one. Trust me. You've never been closer.,12
MULDER,Closer to what?,3
BERUBE,Hello? Hello? Who's there?,4
CREW-CUT MAN,"Working late tonight, doctor?",4
BERUBE,What do you want here?,5
CREW-CUT MAN,"He's alive, isn't he? Has he contacted you?",8
BERUBE,"Please. You're going to have to leave. If you're from the F.B.I., I've already answered all your questions!",18
CREW-CUT MAN,What questions?,2
BERUBE,I had nothing to say to them. I have nothing to say to you.,14
CREW-CUT MAN,Where's Doctor Secare?,3
BERUBE,I don't know what you're talking about. Please. My work is very important. I must get on with my work.,20
CREW-CUT MAN,I'm afraid... Your work is done.,6
MAN #1,Anybody see anything?,3
MAN #2,No.,1
SCUBA DIVER,Nothing!,1
LACERIO,That's it. I'm calling it off. Get those guys out of the water.,13
OFFICER,"Yes, sir. Shore to R.C. One, bring it in.",9
MAN #1,Visibility...,1
MAN #2,...been down there for two days. Forget it.,8
SCULLY,"The county sheriff's office is conducting the investigation. On the preliminary reports, it's being listed as a suicide.",18
MULDER,Suicide?,1
SCULLY,"Yeah, they think that for whatever reason, he trashed his lab and then killed himself.",15
MULDER,How?,1
SCULLY,"Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet. Then he jumped.",27
MULDER,I don't suppose there were any witnesses?,7
SCULLY,Nope.,1
MULDER,The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up. I would have never pegged him as someone to do all this... or a Greg Louganis out the window.,40
SCULLY,"I know, that gauze is troubling.",6
MULDER,"It's a bit too calculated, huh? Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure he'd break his neck before he hit the ground. What else do we know about Doctor Berube?",32
SCULLY,"Ummm... ""Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med., 1974."" He was working on the Human Genome Project. Are you familiar with that?",20
MULDER,Yeah. The mapping of all human genes. Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history of mankind.,18
SCULLY,"Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that. I mean, there were thousands of scientists working on that project.",18
MULDER,"Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungie-jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.",19
SCULLY,"I'm sorry, Mulder. I'm seeing the pieces but I'm not seeing the connection.",13
MULDER,"Well, maybe that's just it. Maybe we're not seeing it because it can't be seen, not in any obvious way. What do you think this is?",26
SCULLY,I don't know.,3
MULDER,"Well, can you find out for me?",7
SCULLY,What are you going to do?,6
MULDER,I'll see what else I can find out about Doctor Terrance Allen Berube.,13
SCULLY,"Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you... if this is monkey pee, you're on your own.",15
CARPENTER,My first impression is it's some kind of bacteria sample. Can I ask you where you got it?,18
SCULLY,It was recovered at a crime scene.,7
CARPENTER,"Well, we've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with the rope, haven't we?",17
SCULLY,"No, I'm expecting it to turn out to be nothing.",10
CARPENTER,"No... no, you've definitely got something here. Wow... look at this.",11
SCULLY,What are they?,3
CARPENTER,"Well, they're the size of bacteria but no bacteria I've ever seen.",12
SCULLY,How do you mean?,4
CARPENTER,"Well, most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth. These are... I don't know. It's strange.",14
SCULLY,You have no way of identifying them?,7
CARPENTER,"Well, we could do a freeze fracture. Take a thin slice off and see what's going on inside these babies. If you don't mind waiting.",25
SCULLY,"No, no, I'll wait.",4
MULDER,"Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again. Look, I got a number this time. 555-2804. Area code 301. I need an address, a name if you can get it for me. All right, I'm at... same prefix... fifteen-seventeen. All right, thanks, Danny. That was fast.",44
SECARE,Terry? Is that you?,4
MULDER,Yeah. Who's this?,3
SECARE,"They shot me, Terry. Oh, God. I've been in the water for three days. I'm hurt.",16
MULDER,Where are you now?,4
SECARE,I'm at a pay phone.,5
MULDER,I'm going to pick you up. Where are you?,9
SECARE,Terry...,1
MULDER,Hello?,1
MAN,Are you okay?,3
MULDER,Are you there? Hello?,4
MAN,"Hello? This man's been hurt here. I, I think he needs medical attention. He's in pretty bad shape...",18
MULDER,What's the street? What's the street?,6
MAN,I'm gonna call an ambulance.,5
MULDER,Sir? Don't hang up.,4
DANNY,I got it.,3
MULDER,"Hi, Danny. Let me get the address...",7
DANNY,"All right, you ready? Mulder?",5
MULDER,"I'm just writing it down now, go ahead.",8
DANNY,"All right, the number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage.",11
MULDER,Yeah...,1
DANNY,Sixteen-sixteen...,1
MULDER,Sixteen...,1
DANNY,Pandora Street.,2
MULDER,Sixteen... Pandora Street.,3
DANNY,That's it.,2
MULDER,"All right, thanks.",3
MAN,"All right, we've got a white male, forty, weak vitals and signs of severe dysnea and hypertension. He also has what appears to be a green fluid coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant.",36
MAN AT HOSPITAL,I don't know what the hell that is. Is he responding to ventilation?,13
MAN,No and we're noticing those rope veins at the neck and a hypersonant sounding chest. He's going real blue on us now.,22
MAN AT HOSPITAL,"Okay, you've got a tension to a thorax. I want you to perform a thorachotomy and release the pressure in his chest.",22
MAN,"Okay, we're going to need a cannula. We're going to do a needle decompression.",14
MAN AT HOSPITAL,"Mobile van, what's going on? Mobile van, can you hear me? Mobile van, answer me! Mobile van, what is the problem? Mobile van, come in please!",26
MULDER,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,It's me.,2
MULDER,"He's alive, Scully.",3
SCULLY,Who?,1
MULDER,"The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera. He called the doctor's house while I was there.",17
SCULLY,Where is he now?,4
MULDER,I don't know. Where are you?,6
SCULLY,I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department. I've got something for you.,11
MULDER,Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?,7
SCULLY,"Much. And it's not silver, it's green.",7
MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,"Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus and it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them. They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts... Plant cells. But they, they've never seen anything like it here.",37
MULDER,Any idea what he could have been doing with them?,10
SCULLY,"Well, the only reason why you clone a virus inside a bacteria......is in order to inject it into something living. It's called gene therapy and it's still highly experimental.",29
MULDER,"Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys. Can they tell you anything else there?",17
SCULLY,"Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence. Now, I may be understating the strangeness of this, Mulder. Bacteria like this... it may have existed, but not for millions of years, not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea. Are you there, Mulder? Mulder?",53
MULDER,"Yeah, Scully. Keep up the good work.",7
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT; 11,45 P.M.,2
CARPENTER,Agent Scully?,2
SCULLY,"Oh, Doctor Carpenter. I fell asleep.",6
CARPENTER,I've done some work. These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in. You seem to know something about molecular biology. Do you know what you're looking at?,31
SCULLY,"Yeah, I think those are genes.",6
CARPENTER,"Right. They're called base pairs. Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide. Only four nucleotides exist in DNA. Four. And through some miracle of design that we have yet to fathom, every living thing is created out of these four basic building blocks. What you're looking at is a sequence of genes from the bacteria sample. Normally, we'd find no gaps in the sequence. But with these bacteria, we do.",73
SCULLY,Why is that?,3
CARPENTER,"I don't know why. But I tell you, under any other circumstances, my first call would have been to the government.",21
SCULLY,What exactly did you find?,5
CARPENTER,"A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide. A new base pair. Agent Scully, what are you looking at... it exists nowhere in nature. IT would have to be, by definition... extraterrestrial.",30
MULDER,Hello.,1
SCULLY,Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been? I've been trying to call you all night.,16
MULDER,I had a situation. I left my phone in the car.,11
SCULLY,Mulder... that bacteria I had analyzed... they're saying that it doesn't exist in nature. They're saying that it could be extraterrestrial.,21
MULDER,Scully...,1
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,How soon can you be here? There's something I got to show you.,13
SCULLY,"Wait a second... Mulder? I, I just want to say that I was wrong.",14
MULDER,"It's all right, don't worry about it.",7
SCULLY,"No, um... if you'd had listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now. I should know by now to trust your instincts.",23
MULDER,Why? Nobody else does.,4
SCULLY,"You know, I've always held science as sacred. I've, I've always put my trust in the accepted facts. And what I saw last night... for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.",37
MULDER,"Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully... when you walk into that room? Nothing sacred will hold. There were tanks here and five bodies suspended in solution. There were computers monitoring them. They were alive, Scully, underwater.",38
SCULLY,What happened to them?,4
DEEP THROAT,"God only knows. Most likely, they've been destroyed. Miss Scully. I believe we met ever so briefly.",17
MULDER,Destroyed by whom?,3
DEEP THROAT,I don't know.,3
MULDER,I don't believe you.,4
DEEP THROAT,"There are limits to my knowledge, Mister Mulder. Inside the intelligence community, there are so-called ""black organizations."" Groups within groups conducting covert activities, unknown at the highest levels of power.",30
MULDER,"There were three men last night, I was chased.",9
DEEP THROAT,"Hmmm. If you were chased, you would have been killed. Those men are trained for that sort of business and they are trained well.",24
SCULLY,Were those the same men who killed Doctor Berube?,9
DEEP THROAT,Presumably.,1
SCULLY,Why?,1
DEEP THROAT,"""Why?"" Good lord, you've worked so hard and you still don't see it.",13
MULDER,Doctor Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses.,9
DEEP THROAT,"Yes, but that's been going on for years. We've had the tissue since 1947 but not the technology.",18
MULDER,Roswell?,1
DEEP THROAT,"Roswell was a smoke screen, we've had a half-a-dozen better salvage operations. Doctor Berube was killed because his work was too successful. You're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took, the first human-alien hybrid was created. Six volunteer patients, all terminally ill. One, Doctor William Secare, an old friend of Doctor Berube's, was dying of melanoma cancer. And as a result of the E.T. gene therapy, all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses. Doctor Secare was able to live a more or less normal life. As normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater.",112
MULDER,That's how he was able to elude capture.,8
DEEP THROAT,Hmmm.,1
SCULLY,What was he running from?,5
DEEP THROAT,"Doctor Secare was never supposed to have survived. Doctor Berube's research was part of a top secret government project being run out of Los Alamos. All they were interested in was the technology, the science. To have a hybrid living out in the real world? Too great a liability. What if he should need emergency medical procedure? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic. That story should hit the press.",76
MULDER,It was just easier to kill Doctor Secare.,8
DEEP THROAT,"Of course, there was only one problem. He was Doctor Berube's old friend and he was able to warn him.",20
SCULLY,There's just one thing I don't understand. Why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning and why are you giving us so much now?,28
DEEP THROAT,"I didn't anticipate the speed and precision of their clean-up operation. They're systematically destroying all the evidence... Doctor Berube, the bodies here. Without the evidence, you two have no case. Who would believe the story I just told you? You must put together everything that you have found and you must find Doctor Secare before they do. I'll have no further contact with you on this matter.",67
SCULLY,I'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work.,13
MULDER,I'm going to find Doctor Secare.,6
SCULLY,Where?,1
MULDER,I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts.,9
SCULLY,Excuse me? I'm looking for Doctor Ann Carpenter. I've been unable to reach her by phone and she's not in her office.,22
WOMAN,"She was in a terrible car accident, her whole family. And Doctor Carpenter is, um... dead.",16
MULDER,Doctor Secare? Wait! I'll protect you.,6
CREW-CUT MAN,Your cellular phone's been ringing off the hook.,8
MULDER,I'm a popular guy. Why don't you answer it for me?,11
CREW-CUT MAN,"Oh, I don't like talking on the phone. I have this thing about unsecured lines. When you feel like talking, let me know, though.",24
MULDER'S APARTMENT; 6,10 A.M.,2
DEEP THROAT,He's not home.,3
SCULLY,Where is he? He's been gone all night.,8
DEEP THROAT,I wish I knew.,4
SCULLY,Something's happened to him.,4
DEEP THROAT,They won't kill him.,4
SCULLY,How do you know that?,5
DEEP THROAT,He's become too high-profile and you've got evidence that could expose them.,12
SCULLY,I don't have any evidence. They took the evidence and they may have killed in order to get it.,19
DEEP THROAT,Listen to me. Evidence still exists.,6
SCULLY,Where?,1
DEEP THROAT,"It might be difficult to obtain but with your medical background, I might be able to get you inside.",19
SCULLY,Inside where?,2
DEEP THROAT,"The high containment facility at Fort Marlene, Maryland.",8
SCULLY,What do they have there?,5
DEEP THROAT,"The wellspring, Miss Scully. The original tissue. If they've got Agent Mulder, they might be willing to make a deal. It could save his life.",25
GUARD,Clear.,1
GUARD,Name?,1
SCULLY,Dana Scully.,2
GUARD,Company or institution?,3
SCULLY,Federal government.,2
GUARD,Project password? Project password?,4
SCULLY,Purity control.,2
GUARD,"Log in, please?",3
SCULLY,You're late.,2
DEEP THROAT,Do you have it?,4
SCULLY,Yes.,1
DEEP THROAT,Good. They're willing to make the exchange.,7
SCULLY,You spoke to them?,4
DEEP THROAT,Yes. I'll take the parcel.,5
SCULLY,"No, sir. I'll make the exchange.",6
DEEP THROAT,"I made the deal, Scully, they're expecting me.",8
SCULLY,I don't trust you.,4
DEEP THROAT,You've got no one else to trust.,7
SCULLY,I don't know who you are. I know nothing about you.,11
DEEP THROAT,"Oh, for God's sake, don't screw this up! Let me tell you something you should know. In 1987, a group of children from a southern state were given what their parents thought was a routine inoculation. What they were injected with was a clone DNA from the contents of that package you're holding as a test. That's the kind of people you're dealing with!",64
SCULLY,So why give it back to them?,7
DEEP THROAT,To save Mulder's life.,4
SCULLY,At the risk of so many other lives?,8
DEEP THROAT,"Oh, it's the tip of the iceberg. You and Mulder are the only ones who can bring it to light. Now, give me the parcel. Give me the parcel, Scully.",30
SCULLY,No! Mulder. Mulder!,3
DEEP THROAT,Trust... Trust... no one.,4
SCULLY,Hello?,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully. It's me.",4
SCULLY,"Where are you? They're shutting us down, Scully.",8
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,They called me in tonight......and they said they're going to reassign us to other sections.,15
SCULLY,Who said that?,3
MULDER,Skinner. He said word came down from the top......of the executive branch.,12
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"It's over, Scully.",3
SCULLY,"Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't...",9
MULDER,"Yes, they can.",3
SCULLY,What are you going to do?,6
MULDER,I'm... not going to give up. I can't give up. Not as long as the truth is out there.,19
