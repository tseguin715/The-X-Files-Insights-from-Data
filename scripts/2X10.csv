MAN,"7:30. See you tomorrow, Beth.",5
BETH KANE,Okay. See you tomorrow.,4
MAN ON TV,Got information on a crackhouse... this is some pretty direct information... came from an informant who made the buy.,19
BETH KANE,I'm home!,2
STEVIE KANE,"Hi, Mom.",2
GARY KANE,Hey.,1
BETH KANE,"""Hey?"" All I get is ""hey?""",6
GARY KANE,"Hey, Mom.",2
BETH KANE,"I'm going to take a quick shower. You guys interested in getting a pizza delivered? If that was a ""yes,"" you can call the order in and no pepperoni for me.",31
GARY KANE,"Hello? Oh, yeah. Sure.",4
STEVIE KANE,Ow!,1
GARY KANE,"Tell Mom I'll be back in five minutes, okay, buttcrumb? the phone. Stevie lays his head on her lap.)",19
BETH KANE,"He said he was only going to be gone five minutes and that was over four hours ago. Yes? No, I don't know who called him. The last person to see him? His younger brother.",35
SHERIFF #1,Whoa whoa whoa!,3
SHERIFF #2,"Gary? Gary Kane? Go get him a blanket. It's going to be okay, son. Hey, we're here to help you! Oh my God.",23
MULDER,"Gary Kane, 16 years old, High School Junior. ""C"" student, first-string varsity football, member of the local 4-H club. Not one of Wisconsin's more remarkable kids but still the apple of his mother's eye.",34
SCULLY,What does that mean?,4
MULDER,Nobody knows.,2
SCULLY,What does the police report say?,6
MULDER,The victim received a phone call and left his home. He was discovered in the woods in his underwear twelve hours later. He's been unable to give a coherent statement.,30
SCULLY,Any evidence of sexual assault?,5
MULDER,No.,1
SCULLY,Does it seem like it might have been a schoolboy prank?,11
MULDER,The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalized since their ordeals. They were reportedly hysterical with fear.,19
SCULLY,Victims? You mean there've been others?,6
MULDER,"One in eastern Wisconsin, one three towns away. Both with the same black words written in black magic marker.",19
SCULLY,What's your interest in this?,5
MULDER,"The local sheriff in Delta Glen, Wisconsin thinks he knows what's been happening to these kids.",16
SCULLY,What's that?,2
MULDER,He thinks they've been possessed.,5
MAZEROSKI,There's something I think you ought to see first. They call themselves the Church of the Red Museum. They're followers of a guy named Odin that moved out here from California three years ago and bought a ranch.,38
SCULLY,"What's the significance of the name ""Red Museum?""",8
MAZEROSKI,"Well, Odin and the rest of them are a bunch of vegetarians. They drove the ranch right into the ground, turned 500 head of beef cattle into pets. Calls it a monument to barbarism.",34
MULDER,Probably went over big with the local ranchers.,8
MAZEROSKI,"Well, you gotta admit, it takes some big ones to set down in the middle of cow country and start a church like his.",24
MAZEROSKI,"Kinda stick out like a sore thumb, don't they?",9
SCULLY,"You know sheriff, from what little we've seen, what, what little you've told us, they seem rather unlikely to be involved in the kind of activities that you described.",29
MAZEROSKI,"Well, I, I won't say another word. You can just see for yourself.",13
CONGREGATION,Ommm...,1
MAZEROSKI,That's Odin.,2
WOMAN,"Today is a blessing from our lord and master, who awaits his flock in this time, the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. Eighteen earth years from the beginning of the new kingdom. The guides speak through me today as messengers of word that we may be free from death and the passage into spirit. As the acceleration continues, we, the enlightened, must bring our teachings of the skills for survival to mankind. Repeat in prayer...",76
MULDER,They're walk-ins.,2
SCULLY,What are walk-ins?,3
WOMAN,"We, the second souls of the first bodies...",8
CONGREGATION,"We, the second souls of the first bodies...",8
WOMAN,Bearers of the word and keepers of the sacraments of a new enlightenment...,13
MULDER,"They're believers in soul transference, enlightened spirits who have taken possession of other peoples bodies.",15
CONGREGATION,Bearers of the word and keepers of the sacraments of a new enlightenment...,13
WOMAN,Blessed mission and toil.,4
CONGREGATION,Blessed mission and toil.,4
WOMAN,"Our struggle is transcendent, and your guidance, our guides...",9
CONGREGATION,"Our struggle is transcendent, and your guidance, our guides...",9
WOMAN,...will carry us toward the dawning of a new age.,10
CONGREGATION,...will carry us toward the dawning of a new age.,10
WOMAN,"Today, we bear witness to three who do not believe. We encourage them to open their hearts and minds to our teachings that they who slaughter the flesh slaughter their own souls and must be taught the way.",38
GARY KANE,I only remember parts of it.,6
MULDER,Which parts are those?,4
GARY KANE,I was in the woods and... I felt... a spirit enter me.,12
MULDER,"When you say spirit, Gary, I'm not sure what you mean.",11
GARY KANE,It... it might have been an animal spirit. I can't explain it. Something... just came over me.,17
MULDER,And you don't remember who called you? Anything at all about what happened immediately after you left home that night? Have you ever had any dealings with anyone from the Church of the Red Museum?,35
GARY KANE,I've seen them around.,4
MULDER,Do you have any reason to believe that they may be involved with what happened to you?,17
MAZEROSKI,"Now tell him what you told me, Gary.",8
SCULLY,Hi.,1
STEVIE KANE,Hi.,1
SCULLY,Who are you?,3
STEVIE KANE,Stevie.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, you're in all the pictures. You must be Gary's younger brother. I'm Dana. Stevie... do you remember who your brother might have gone out to see the other night? Did he say anything?",34
MULDER,"Scully, we'll meet you outside.",5
SCULLY,"Well, thank you for your time.",6
MULDER,Has this boy ever been in any trouble?,8
MAZEROSKI,Gary?,1
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MAZEROSKI,"No, I've known him since he was a kid. Same age as my son. Now, he's done some beer drinking, but he's just your basic sixteen-year-old. Least he was.",29
MULDER,You see a noticeable difference in him?,7
MAZEROSKI,"Yeah, yeah. Gary Kane lived for football. He's a damn good athlete too. Now he won't even suit up.",19
MULDER,The Red Museum... how are they treated by the local citizens?,11
MAZEROSKI,Nobody much cares for them.,5
MULDER,"Well, are they ever singled out? Shop owners refusing to sell to them, stuff like that?",16
MAZEROSKI,"Well, there's a reasonable amount of tension but most folks are happy to just try to avoid them.",18
MULDER,"Uh, can you recommend a good motel in the area?",10
MAZEROSKI,Sure. That means you're going to stay on for a bit. You think there might be something to this?,19
MULDER,"Well, I, I want to run a background check on the church and this guy",15
MAZEROSKI,You've come to the right place for that.,8
SCULLY,"You know, Mulder... ribs like these, I'd say the Church of the Red Museum has its work cut out for it. Thanks. So, you started to tell me about walk-ins but I'm not sure if I grasped the finer points.",40
MULDER,"Well, it, it's kind of a new age religion based on an old idea. That if you, uh, lose hope or despair and want to leave this mortal coil, you become open and vulnerable.",34
SCULLY,To inhabitation by a new spirit.,6
MULDER,"A new enlightened spirit. According to the literature, Abe Lincoln was a walk-in. And Mikhail Gorbachev and Charles Colson, Nixon's advisor.",21
SCULLY,But not Nixon?,3
MULDER,No. Not even they want to claim Nixon.,8
SCULLY,So are you still subscribing to the sheriff's claims of a possession?,12
MULDER,I don't know. In the absence of any other plausible explanation... it's a novel theory.,15
SCULLY,"Well, I'll tell you something, I kind of feel weird saying this......but I got the creeps in that apartment today.",20
MULDER,Really?,1
TEENAGER,"Hey, you tofu-eating towelhead!",4
SCULLY,"Yeah, what, what's going on?",5
TEENAGER,"Hey, veggieburger, who let you out!",6
MULDER,I think the sperm posse just rode into town.,9
RICK MAZEROSKI,"Hey, diaperhead! We're talking to you. How's your pet cow?",10
TEENAGER,Did you get any milk out of him?,8
RICK MAZEROSKI,"We're talking to you, Aladdin. What's the matter, diaperhead? Huh? Huh?",11
RED MUSEUM TEENAGER,Nothing.,1
MULDER,"Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone. Go home. Go ahead, go home.",13
TEENAGER,"Catch you later, Red.",4
MULDER,You got a problem?,4
KATIE,"Yeah, but who asked you?",5
MULDER,I see four against one. I got a problem.,9
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
RICK MAZEROSKI,"Yeah, well, why don't you run along with the little wife? You're going to miss the tour bus.",18
FEMALE TEENAGER,She's got a gun.,4
RICK MAZEROSKI,"Well, what's she going to do, shoot us? Go call my dad, Katie, I think he'd like to hear about this.",21
MULDER,Who's your dad?,3
RICK MAZEROSKI,He's the sheriff.,3
MULDER,"Yeah, I think he would like to hear about this.",10
TEENAGER,"Come on, let's just get out of here, Rick.",9
SCULLY,Kind of hard to tell the villains without a scorecard.,10
KATIE,"Pupperdog? Is that you? Pupperdog? What are you doing here, huh, girl? Get off me. Get off me! Help me! Please, somebody, help me! Help me! Please!",27
MULDER,"Yeah, Eddie, this is all good stuff. Yeah, see what else you can find on him from the N.C.I.C. and call me back. At, at this number or on my cellular.",31
SCULLY,I just examined the girl.,5
MULDER,What'd you find?,3
SCULLY,"Not much until the toxicology report came back. They found trace amounts of an unspecified alkaloid substance in her blood, possibly an opiate derivative, as well as a dangerously large quantity of something called scopolamine.",35
MULDER,Is that the stuff they use for motion sickness?,9
SCULLY,"Well, only in very small doses. Anything past .2 micrograms and you've got a very powerful anesthetic with hallucinogenic qualities. It's been in the news lately because Colombian gangs have been using it in kidnappings to subdue their victims.",39
MULDER,Is it a controlled substance?,5
SCULLY,"Yes, you'd probably have to be a doctor or a pharmacist to get hold of these quantities. ""Richard Odin. Also known as Doug Herman. Left A.M.A. in 1986 over questionable ethics inquiry. Did not renew license.""",36
MULDER,I'll drive.,2
MULDER,I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We'd like to speak to Richard Odin. Is he in?,22
WOMAN,Just a moment.,3
MULDER,Richard Odin?,2
ODIN,Yes.,1
MULDER,We'd like to ask you some questions. May we come inside?,11
ODIN,I'm sorry. I can't allow you in this house.,9
SCULLY,We can get a warrant if that's what it takes.,10
ODIN,"You can get a warrant if you'd like, but you will not enter this building.",15
MULDER,"Well, how's that?",3
ODIN,Because you're meat-eaters. The building that houses our kitchens cannot be desecrated by your presence. I believe I'm well within my religious rights to prevent it.,26
SCULLY,"Yes, sir, but you can't hide behind your rights if a crime has been committed.",15
ODIN,Have I been accused of a crime?,7
CONGREGATION,Ommm...,1
MULDER,"We can always determine that elsewhere. Can you step outside, please, sir? Can you step outside, Mr. Odin? We're placing you under arrest.",23
SCULLY,"Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine, Mister Odin?",10
ODIN,Are you familiar with bovine growth hormones and inhumane treatment of beef and dairy cow...,15
MULDER,"Just answer the question, Mister Odin.",6
ODIN,"Yes, I know it. But I've never prescribed it or administered it.",12
SCULLY,Have you ever ordered others to do so?,8
ODIN,No.,1
MULDER,"Do your religious beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge, either physically or psychically, on those who might not share them?",20
ODIN,The barbarians will one day be cleansed from the earth...,10
MAZEROSKI,"Answer the question! You did it, didn't you? You did something to those kids!",14
MULDER,Sheriff...I've already had to go through this once with your kid. Can you just take a walk?,17
DEPUTY OUTSIDE,"Hey, sheriff, can you come here for a second?",9
MULDER,"You know, for a holy man, you've got quite a knack for pissing people off.",15
MAZEROSKI,We got problems down the street.,6
WOMAN,Keep your mind open to the wisdom of the guide.,10
MAN #1,We don't care about the wisdom of the guides!,9
WOMAN,All we ask is that you listen and...,8
MAN #2,Woo!,1
TEENAGER,"All right, man, let's do it!",6
WOMAN,...before it is too late. End the slaughter. The rights of the just must be protected.,16
MAN #1,Please!,1
WOMAN,Just as the barbarism against nature must cease. Violence against nature begets violence against man.,15
RICK MAZEROSKI,How about a little cow blood?,6
MAZEROSKI,"What do you think you're doing? Get out of here, get going. Get!",13
OLD MAN,You the F.B.I. agents?,4
SCULLY,Yes.,1
OLD MAN,There's something I'd like to show you.,7
OLD MAN,"This pastureland belonged to my granddad. He bought it in 1890. Yeah, he died right over there, next to that cattle pen. Eighty-two years old. Just fell off the tractor one morning. My dad worked this piece for the next forty years. I put in twenty-five myself before I decided to call it quits. Sold it for eighty times what my granddad paid.",63
SCULLY,Why did you sell it?,5
OLD MAN,Ah... business changed. People changed too.,6
MULDER,In what way?,3
OLD MAN,"Competition. Used to get by with fifty milk cows. Now, you got to have five hundred. Used to turn them out to pasture, now you keep them in pens and grain feed them.",33
SCULLY,You said you wanted to show us something.,8
OLD MAN,"You're looking at it. See those men over there? Well, they're injecting the cattle with something called B.S.T. Bovine somatotrophin.",20
SCULLY,A genetically-engineered growth hormone.,4
OLD MAN,"Yeah, shoot them up and the cow will produce ten percent more milk. Feed it to beef cattle, more meat on the hoof. Changed the business. Changed a whole lot of things.",32
SCULLY,How do you mean?,4
OLD MAN,"Well, that, uh, fracas in town this afternoon. Ten, even five years ago, never would have happened. People around here have changed... gotten mean... spiteful... dog-eat-dog. We had seven rapes here last year by high school boys. Well, that, um... this, this business of the kids being found in the woods... well, I think that you're going to find it all comes from the same root source.",67
MULDER,The growth hormone.,3
OLD MAN,"Yes, sir.",2
SCULLY,But these hormones have been proven safe. They've been cleared by the F.D.A.,13
OLD MAN,Says who? The government? God...,5
MAN,"Yeah, that's good.",3
PILOT,"I don't know, doc. I'm losing oil pressure like crazy. I don't know what's going on!",16
LARSON,How far are we from the airport?,7
PILOT,We're not going to make it. I'll have to find someplace to put it down.,15
LARSON,Look out!,2
MAZEROSKI,We're still trying to I.D. the pilot.,7
SCULLY,What about the second body?,5
MAZEROSKI,That's Doctor Jerrold Larson.,4
MULDER,Did you know him?,4
MAZEROSKI,Yeah. He delivered my kid. Something else over here I want you to see.,14
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
MULDER,Looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies.,11
MAZEROSKI,That's why I brought you out here.,7
MULDER,Any clue what this is about?,6
MAZEROSKI,I have no idea. Jerry Larson was a pillar in this community. He was the last of the country doctors.,20
MULDER,"Well, wherever he was coming from, I'd say that was one hell of a house call.",16
MAZEROSKI,You don't think this has anything to do with what happened to those kids?,14
SCULLY,I think we'll know more once we find out what this is.,12
SCULLY,"You're sure? Both kids? No, it's okay, I'm... I'm sure you're correct. Thank you very much.",16
MULDER,Scully? You're not going to believe this.,7
SCULLY,You found a connection between the out-of-town kids and the kids abducted here. Every one of them was delivered and treated through childhood by Doctor Larson.,26
MULDER,"Yeah, the print-outs we found in the briefcase were mostly shipping orders along with a list of credit card numbers, each number corresponding to a card in the victim's family.",30
SCULLY,Why would he carry a list of credit card numbers?,10
MULDER,I don't know. Maybe to track them the way credit card companies track stolen cards?,15
SCULLY,But why? And what was he treating them for?,9
MULDER,What was he treating them with?,6
SCULLY,I don't know. We won't get the test results back on the vial until tomorrow. Are you thinking it might be bovine growth hormone?,24
MULDER,"I know that was the first thing through both of our minds, Scully, but it just doesn't track. Not with that briefcase full of cash.",25
SCULLY,I know. And it still doesn't answer the question of who's marking those kids... or why.,16
MAN,Go on. Away we go.,5
GERD THOMAS,"So, I'll see you in the morning?",7
MAN,Yeah. 8:30 sharp. Howdy.,4
SCULLY,Hi. Sorry to come unannounced.,5
BETH KANE,Gary's not home right now.,5
SCULLY,"Actually, we wanted to talk with you, if that's okay.",10
BETH KANE,I don't know what to say. You think Doctor Larson was doing some kind of tests on Gary?,18
SCULLY,"Well, thinking back, was there anything that seemed strange to you? Was Gary sick often?",15
BETH KANE,"No. Actually, Gary's never been sick a day in his life.",11
MULDER,Gary was never sick.,4
BETH KANE,No.,1
SCULLY,Why was he going to Doctor Larson?,7
BETH KANE,Doctor Larson gave him vitamin shots. He gave them to a lot of kids. He said it was like treating their teeth with fluoride... as a preventative measure.,28
MULDER,Did you ever take Gary to another doctor?,8
BETH KANE,No. Jay had wanted to.,5
SCULLY,Jay's your husband?,3
BETH KANE,Yes. He was concerned that Gary wasn't growing. Jay was six-five. He wanted Gary to play college ball. But then there was Jay's accident.,24
SCULLY,What accident?,2
BETH KANE,It was seven years ago. He worked at the packing plant. He had an accident with one of the machines.,20
MULDER,Excuse me? What is this?,5
BETH KANE,What?,1
MULDER,This light here.,3
BETH KANE,I don't know.,3
MULDER,There's something back there.,4
SCULLY,"What is it, Mulder?",4
MULDER,Looks like somebody's private little movie studio.,7
SCULLY,What?,1
BETH KANE,Oh my God.,3
TEENAGER,I got to drain the lizard.,6
RICK MAZEROSKI,"What do you want, applause, man?",6
TEENAGER,Rick? Rick?,2
DEPUTY,Sheriff? We're going to find who did this to him...,10
MAZEROSKI,"Get away from him. Get back. Oh my God... Ricky! Son... No. No, no!",14
SCULLY,His name is Gerd Thomas. He's owned the building for twenty-one years. He used to run a day-care center out of it. They're holding him for us.,27
MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,I know that face.,4
MULDER,What?,1
MULDER,That's quite a video library you've compiled for yourself. I especially like the ones with the little boys.,18
GERD THOMAS,I know. I'm... a sick man.,6
MULDER,"No. No, men who know they're sick try to get help. You just kept right at it for years.",19
GERD THOMAS,I didn't mean to hurt anyone.,6
MULDER,Did you kidnap those kids?,5
GERD THOMAS,Yes.,1
MULDER,Are you prepared to confess to those crimes?,8
GERD THOMAS,Yes.,1
MULDER,And to the murders of Rick Mazeroski and...,8
GERD THOMAS,No. I never murdered anybody.,5
MULDER,"Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski? ""He is One"" and a picture of Rick's dead body.) Did you write this on his back?",22
GERD THOMAS,Oh my God...,3
MULDER,Answer the question.,3
GERD THOMAS,"No, I... I never killed them. I never killed anybody, I... I really loved those kids.",16
MULDER,Is this how you express your love for them? Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski? Did you write that on his back?,21
GERD THOMAS,Yes!,1
MULDER,Why?,1
GERD THOMAS,Because of what he had become.,6
MULDER,What'd he become?,3
GERD THOMAS,Because those kids have become monsters.,6
MULDER,"You're not making any sense. Now, you... make sense to me.",11
GERD THOMAS,"Because of Doctor Larson, because of the tests.",8
SCULLY,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,"Okay, what tests?",3
GERD THOMAS,Doctor Larson was using those kids as guinea pigs and he was using us too.,15
MULDER,"What do you mean, ""using you?""",6
GERD THOMAS,To inoculate the cattle.,4
MULDER,With growth hormone?,3
GERD THOMAS,I don't know exactly what it was but he was paying us a lot of money to do it.,19
MULDER,So you're saying that Doctor Larson was paying you a lot of money to inject the cattle with something and you didn't know what it was.,26
GERD THOMAS,Not until later. Not until after all those rapes. Doctor Larson told my boss that he felt responsible for everything that those kids had done... and that he was giving them the same inoculations.,34
MULDER,Was Doctor Larson involved in the kidnapping?,7
GERD THOMAS,"No, no... he didn't want his secret to come out. He didn't care about those kids like me.",18
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
MULDER,Mm-hmm?,1
SCULLY,"I, uh... I think he's telling the truth. I don't think he killed anyone.",14
MULDER,"Well, how can you be sure?",6
SCULLY,"I just got the toxicology report back on the broken vial. The residual substance couldn't be analyzed because it contained synthetic corticosteroids with unidentified amino acids. That's ""Purity Control,"" Mulder.",30
MULDER,"Do you know what you're saying, Scully?",7
SCULLY,The man who died in that plane crash was inoculating those kids with antibodies derived from what may have been an extraterrestrial source.,23
MULDER,He's been injecting those kids with alien DNA.,8
SCULLY,"No, Mulder, that was never proven conclusively.",7
MULDER,"But it's the same substance we found in the Erlenmeyer flask, isn't it? The same material my Deep Throat contact died for.",22
SCULLY,Yes.,1
MULDER,"It all makes sense. The money in the briefcase, they've been conducting an experiment here. Somebody's been paying to have those kids injected with alien DNA to see how they'd react. It's been going on for years.",37
SCULLY,Does that man know anything about it?,7
MULDER,No. He's just some poor soul who blew their cover. I don't think he knows any more than he's telling us.,21
SCULLY,"Well, I think his boss must have because they just found him shot to death in a cow pasture.",19
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,"I think I know who shot him, Mulder. That man that I recognized on the road today... that's the same man that executed Deep Throat.",25
MULDER,"Well, whoever's behind this, he's here covering their tracks. He's going to go after the kids. You get the sheriff and meet me at Gary Kane's apartment. And, Scully... I want this guy alive.",34
MULDER,Where's Gary?,2
BETH KANE,He's in his bedroom.,4
MULDER,"Go pack some clothes, things you need. You're all coming with me.",12
BETH KANE,What?,1
MULDER,"I'll explain later. Those credit card numbers, every kid's family that was listed. Get them packed up. Call out every man you've got.",23
MAZEROSKI,Where are we taking them?,5
ODIN,Yes?,1
MULDER,I need your help.,4
ODIN,For?,1
MULDER,It may offend your religious sensibilities but it could help save some kids' lives.,14
SCULLY,Sheriff... where's Mulder?,3
MAZEROSKI,He told me to make sure that the kids were safe. He thought there was some other place this guy might be.,22
MULDER,Stop right there! Hey!,4
SCULLY,Don't move! Put it down. Now. Just put the lighter down.,11
MULDER,Hey! Get him out of here. Get everyone out of here!,11
DEPUTY,Come on.,2
SCULLY,"File number XWC060361. The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse has yet to be determined. His name, any record or artifact of his past, present or immigration status have yet to be found. His fingerprints are not on file in either the F.B.I. or National System of Records. At this time, it remains doubtful that anyone will come forward to I.D. or claim the body.",67
SCULLY,"Under further analysis, the inoculant found in the broken vials was isolated and determined to be an unstable antibody of no known biological origin. After three weeks of study, the components of the serum, probably synthetic, have broken down structurally and, in this retrograde state, cannot be analyzed further. This coincides with the development of a severe and undiagnosed flu-like ailment affecting the children who were believed to be inoculated and some of the local families. To date, none of the congregants or members of the Church of the Red Museum have contracted this illness. I suspect whoever was doing may have been using them as a control group. The shipping manifests for what is believed to be milk and beef tainted by the unspecified inoculant do not provide enough information to track their destinations. A local advisory and quarantine have been established. Further inquiry into the tainted beef has been promised by the pertinent government health agencies. The F.B.I. investigation into this case is currently at a standstill. The case remains open and unsolved.",175
