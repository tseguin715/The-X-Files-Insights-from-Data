GEORGE,"We don't have to be out here, you know. It's not like you're still in high school. We can go to the motel.",23
PAULA,Mm-mm. I wouldn't want anyone to see us.,8
GEORGE,No one’ll see us.,4
PAULA,It's a small town.,4
PAULA,"George... Come on, George.",4
GEORGE,Why'd ya change your mind anyway?,6
PAULA,"I don’t know. You were pretty persistent, I guess.",9
GEORGE,"Squeaky wheel gets the oil, right?",6
PAULA,I guess so.,3
GEORGE,What's wrong with right here? I can just set the blanket down and...,13
PAULA,Not yet.,2
GEORGE,Why not?,2
PAULA,Because... You have to catch me first.,7
GEORGE,"Aw, come on, now. You don't want me to chase after you, do you?",14
GEORGE,Paula! Paula? …,3
GEORGE,Paula. Where are you?,4
GEORGE,Son of a bitch!,4
MULDER,"I don’t know, Scully, the man’s vanished. He hasn’t been seen or heard from in ten weeks.",17
SCULLY,"Come on, Mulder, don't you see what they're doing? They're wasting our time. They're sending us on some kind of a wild goose chase.",24
MULDER,"Chicken chase. George Kearns was a federal poultry inspector assigned to Dudley, Arkansas, home of … Chaco Chicken.",18
SCULLY,"I'm not questioning the case's legitimacy, just their motives in assigning it to us. I mean, doesn't it bother you at all that they're undermining your work?",27
MULDER,"They may ""think"" they are, but on the night George Kearns disappeared a woman on the I-10 saw a strange fire in an adjacent field.",25
SCULLY,"Yes, I read that report. She claims that she saw some kind of a-a foxfire spirit. I'm surprised she didn't call Oprah as soon as she got off the phone with the police.",33
MULDER,Folktales dating back to the 19th century from the Ozarks describe people being taken away by fireballs. It's supposed to be the spirits of massacred Indians.,26
SCULLY,"Those are only legends, Mulder.",5
MULDER,"Well, most legends don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks. That photo was taken by state police in the field where the woman claims to have seen foxfire.",27
SCULLY,This could have been made by anything-- a bonfire.,9
MULDER,I thought so too. Until I remembered this. It's a documentary I saw when I was in college about an insane asylum. Gave me nightmares.,25
SCULLY,I didn’t think anything gave you nightmares.,7
MULDER,"Unh, I was young.",4
JONES,"No...They, uh... See, they took... They, uh... They took me away... They took me away-- the fire demons. The fire demons... the fire demons wanted their pound of flesh but, uh... I'm too fast for them. They cannot kill you. See, you can't let them kill you. Oh, no. Don't let them kill you. Don't let them kill you. That's no way to get to heaven. No, sir. No, sir. That's no way to get to heaven....",77
MULDER,"His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled off the road on May 17, 1961 to take a nap. They found him three days later so deranged by what he'd encountered that he had to be committed. The state police found his car on the I-10 right in the middle of Dudley, Arkansas, … home of Chaco Chicken.",57
SCULLY,"What's this, Mulder?",3
MULDER,That's a witch's peg. Staking it into the ground is supposed to ward off evil spirits.,16
SHERIFF ARENS,Can I help you folks? I'm Sheriff Arens. I saw you back at the turnoff.,15
MULDER,We're with the FBI. I’m Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. Were investigating the disappearance of George Kearns.,19
SHERIFF ARENS,I'm happy to help you but I’m not sure how much there is to investigate.,15
SCULLY,"Well, Sheriff Arens, a man is missing.",7
SHERIFF ARENS,We didn't find any evidence of criminal activity and since no body turned up we just went ahead and filed a missing persons report.,24
MULDER,Why didn't you mention this witch's peg in your report?,10
SHERIFF ARENS,Because these fields are filled with witch's pegs. A lot of these old hill people cling tight to their superstitions.,20
MULDER,What about the scorched area?,5
SHERIFF ARENS,Illegal trash burning. I keep handing out the citations. They keep doing it anyway. It's cheaper to pay the fine than to haul it to the dump.,27
MULDER,So you don’t believe it’s foxfire?,6
SHERIFF ARENS,"Sir, foxfire's nothing more than a ghost story about swamp gas.",11
SHERIFF ARENS,"I don't know what y'all are thinking, but George Kearns was passing through town since he got here six months ago.",21
SCULLY,How do you mean?,4
SHERIFF ARENS,"Never did fit in-- not at the plant, not even at his own home. It's no big secret that Kearns stepped out on his wife every chance he got.",29
SCULLY,Did he have many chances?,5
SHERIFF ARENS,Let's just say George is the type of man you'd expect to go chasing some sweet young thing out of town.,21
SCULLY,Is that what his wife thinks happened?,7
SHERIFF ARENS,"Push comes to shove, I’m sure she does. But, you're welcome to ask her yourself.",15
DORIS,My husband had a character that leaves something out. I always knew that about him but I didn't have the sense to do anything about it. I guess he saved me the trouble.,33
SCULLY,So you're fairly certain that he left you for somebody else.,11
DORIS,George left me a long time ago. Right around the time I turned 40. Leaving town was just a formality.,20
SCULLY,Do you have any idea who he might be with now?,11
DORIS,"No. And I don't want to know, either.",8
MULDER,This inspection report-- your husband was about to file it with the Department of Agriculture the day before he disappeared.,20
DORIS,I don’t know anything about that.,6
MULDER,He never discussed his work with you?,7
DORIS,He never told me and I never asked.,8
MULDER,"Well, he cited several major health violations. He was gonna recommend that the plant be shut down.",17
DORIS,"I told you, I don’t know a thing about what went on in that plant.",15
SCULLY,Did your husband ever receive any threatening phone calls or anything unusual in the mail?,15
DORIS,Sure. There were hang-ups but I always thought it was one of his girlfriends.,14
MULDER,Let me give you my phone number. If your husband tries to contact you I want you to get in touch with me. Or if you can think of anything else.,31
WORKER,"Come on, Paula. Let’s go.",5
SHERIFF ARENS,"This is Jess Harold. He's the floor manager here. Jess, these people are with the FBI.",16
JESS HAROLD,"Oh, you're here about George Kearns, right?",7
SCULLY,"Well, there’s a possibility that his disappearance may have something to do with a report he was about to file with the Department of Agriculture.",25
JESS HAROLD,You got to understand that ever since he got here George has been trying to shut us down.,18
SCULLY,Well he cited multiple violations.,5
JESS HAROLD,"I know he did. Believe me, I had to answer to every one.",13
SCULLY,Was there any merit to his claims?,7
JESS HAROLD,Let me show you something.,5
COWORKER,"Paula, you okay?",3
JESS HAROLD,This is where George worked. Not a chicken leaves here without passing through the inspector's station. We've been operating here for 50 years without any trouble with the USDA. Until George came along.,33
SCULLY,So he really did threaten to shut the plant down.,10
JESS HAROLD,"Oh, he tried, but we got three other inspectors here who consistently give us top marks. Here, see for yourself. No, the only problem this plant ever had was George.",30
SCULLY,Problem enough to do something about?,6
JESS HAROLD,"If you're suggesting any kind of unsavoriness, I guess anything's possible, but you’ve got to understand about George. He had a bone to pick with everyone-- even the federal government.",30
SCULLY,What are you talking about?,5
JESS HAROLD,"He filed a big worker's compensation suit-- claimed he was getting terrible headaches from his job. ""Line hypnosis"" his lawyers called it.",22
SCULLY,"Yeah, I read about that. It's caused by high-speed repetitive activity.",11
JESS HAROLD,"I will not deny that a lot of chickens go through here every day, but we've always operated well within federal guidelines.",22
SCULLY,What happened to his lawsuit?,5
JESS HAROLD,"Well, it was dismissed just a few weeks before he disappeared.",11
MULDER,What’s that?,2
JESS HAROLD,"Oh, that... It's a feed grinder. Chops up bone and tissue. See, any part of the bird we can't package we process, use as feed.",25
MULDER,Chickens feed on chickens?,4
JESS HAROLD,"I know it doesn't sound too appetizing, but it is nutritious and it cuts down on costs. The meat is cooked and mixed with grain. No reason letting all that protein go to waste.",34
JESS HAROLD,You'll have to excuse me. I got a shift change.,10
SHERIFF ARENS,Logan…,1
SCULLY,"So, Mulder, are you ready to admit they sent us on a fool's errand?",14
MULDER,"If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise, Scully.",13
SCULLY,"Well, whether George Kearns skipped town or somebody killed him, this case could've been handled by any agent under the Kansas City office.",23
MULDER,I’m not so sure about that.,6
MULDER,: Let him go. We’re federal agents SCULLY. Everyone stay calm. Don't hurt him. Just tell us what you want. Don’t get excited. Just calm down. Stay calm. We don’t want anyone to get hurt. We can talk this thing out. Why don’t you give me the knife?,47
SCULLY,You okay?,2
SCULLY,Do you have any idea what might have prompted her attack?,11
JESS HAROLD,None at all.,3
SCULLY,No recent complaints or strange behavior?,6
JESS HAROLD,"Paula has always been one of our best employees -- stable, well-liked... I can't even begin to imagine what brought this on.",21
MULDER,"What about you, Dr. Randolph? Do you have any ideas?",10
JESS HAROLD,"If you're done with me, I got work to do.",10
DR. RANDOLPH,Come by tomorrow. Let me make sure it's not infected.,10
JESS HAROLD,Sure.,1
DR. RANDOLPH,"Uh, Paula came by last week complaining of persistent headaches. She'd suddenly started getting... irritable, unable to sleep.",18
SCULLY,Were you able to determine the cause?,7
DR. RANDOLPH,No. I'm just the staff physician. I don't usually treat anything more difficult than a hand injury. I'm out of my depth in psychiatric matters.,25
SCULLY,You didn't find anything physically wrong with her?,8
DR. RANDOLPH,I sent her to County for a brain scan and EEG. Both came back normal so I just assumed her condition was stress-related.,23
SCULLY,Could it have been line hypnosis?,6
DR. RANDOLPH,"Like I said, I'm not qualified to make that diagnosis.",10
MULDER,But you can tell us whether George Kearns came to you with any similar complaints.,15
DR. RANDOLPH,"They presented similar symptoms, yeah.",5
SCULLY,How did you treat them?,5
DR. RANDOLPH,I treated them both with pain medication-- codeine.,8
SCULLY,"Well, I think an autopsy on Paula Gray would clarify things.",11
DR. RANDOLPH,I'm afraid I can't authorize that. You'd have to speak with Mr. Chaco.,13
SCULLY,Why? You're a physician.,4
DR. RANDOLPH,"Yeah, but Mr. Chaco was Paula Gray's grandfather and her legal guardian.",12
MULDER,Mr. Chaco?,2
CHACO,"Feeding these chickens helps me clear my mind. They're perfect creatures, you know. We eat their meat, their eggs. We sleep on pillows stuffed with their feathers. Not many people I know are as useful as these chickens.",38
SCULLY,"We’re sorry to disturb you, sir. We realize this is a difficult time for you.",15
CHACO,You want to conduct an autopsy on my granddaughter. Why? You think Paula had some kind of disease that made her act that way?,24
SCULLY,That's what we're hoping a postmortem will determine.,8
CHACO,Thought your business here was George Kearns' disappearance.,8
MULDER,"It is, but we suspect that might have something to do with what happened to your granddaughter.",17
CHACO,How?,1
MULDER,"We’re not sure yet, but it's possible they may have both suffered from the same neurological disorder.",17
CHACO,"You know, when I came here after the war, Dudley was just a patch of dirt. I built that plant and put my whole family to work there. We made this town one of the biggest chicken processors in the nation. We couldn't have done that with troublemakers and layabouts.",50
SCULLY,I assume you’re talking about George Kearns.,7
CHACO,Men like George Kearns don't build things. They tend to tear them down.,13
SCULLY,Then you're aware of his recommendation to close down your plant?,11
CHACO,"You know, living a long life is a mixed blessing. You spend your youth trying to build something for yourself and your family and your community only to watch it all taken away from you at your old age. Still... I'm not ready to die just yet. You go do your autopsy on Paula. I want to know what happened to my granddaughter.",63
SCULLY,"I think we’ve got something here, Mulder. Take a look at this.",12
MULDER,What am I looking at?,5
SCULLY,It's a specimen from Paula Gray's brain. She suffered from a rare degenerative disorder called Creutzfeldt- Jacob disease. It's characterized by the formation of spongelike holes in the brain tissue.,30
MULDER,Why didn't this show up on any of her charts?,10
SCULLY,Short of an autopsy it's very difficult to diagnose. Outside of a textbook I’ve only seen infected tissue once and that was back in medical school.,26
MULDER,Could this be the reason she attacked Jess Harold?,9
SCULLY,"Absolutely. Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jacob suffer from progressive dementia, severe seizures...",10
MULDER,Is it fatal?,3
SCULLY,This girl would have been dead in months.,8
MULDER,"Except that Paula Gray was no girl. This is her personnel file, Scully. Check it out. It says here that Paula Gray was born in 1948, which means that this woman-- Chaco’s granddaughter-- was 47 years old.",37
SCULLY,There’s got to be some kind of a mistake.,9
MULDER,"Let's find out. Her birth certificate should be on file at the Seth County courthouse. Who knows, Scully? This could be *even* more interesting than foxfire.",26
SCULLY,The odds that Paula Gray and George Kearns had the same disease are practically nonexistent. Creutzfeldt-Jacob can be hereditary but it's not communicable. That two unrelated people in the same small town would contract the same rare disease is...,39
MULDER,…A lot more likely than Paula Gray being three years shy of her 50th birthday.,15
SCULLY,"Mulder, look out!",3
MULDER,Call an ambulance. I’ll try to get the driver out.,10
SCULLY,This is Federal Agent Scully. I’d like to report an accident on Count A7 …,15
SCULLY,I just got off the phone with Dr. Randolph. He said this driver had the same symptoms as Paula Gray and George Kearns.,23
MULDER,You're saying this is a third victim of Creutzfeldt-Jacob? You just got through telling me that two cases would be statistically impossible.,22
SCULLY,"Well, they would be. I just came up with a sick theory, Mulder.",13
MULDER,"Ooh, I’m listening.",3
SCULLY,You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What if somebody put George Kearns’s body in there? Creutzfeldt-Jacob is a prion disease which means it could have been passed on to the chickens and in turn anyone who consumed them.,40
MULDER,So anyone eating chickens out of Dudley would be at risk?,11
SCULLY,"It's possible. You know, sometimes in England they'll incinerate cattle to keep them from passing mad cow disease on to people.",21
MULDER,"Yeah, but chickens from Dudley are shipped all over the country. If what you’re saying were true, we'd be seeing an epidemic not just a few local cases.",28
MULDER,Sheriff Arens? What's wrong with this water?,7
SHERIFF ARENS,"Runoff from the plant. Chicken litter, mostly. Some blood and parts from the birds.",14
MULDER,Was this river searched after George Kearns disappeared?,8
SHERIFF ARENS,Talk about a needle in a haystack.,7
MULDER,"Well, I’d like it dragged as soon as possible.",9
SHERIFF ARENS,Why would you want to do that?,7
MULDER,To see what's in there.,5
SHERIFF ARENS,"Well, listen, that's a filthy job and I don't particularly want to do it unless I know what it is you're looking for.",23
MULDER,Hopefully nothing.,2
MULDER,"Look, Sheriff Arens, if you don't want to do it I can get some of my men down here to do it.",22
SHERIFF ARENS,I'll do it.,3
SCULLY,Mulder ….,2
MULDER,"Oh, it's just a hunch. If George Kearns didn’t run off, if he was murdered for that inspection report then his body's got to be somewhere.",26
SHERIFF ARENS,"We closed the spillway, and the water level dropped. They came up with it almost immediately.",16
MULDER,Did you find Kearns?,4
SHERIFF ARENS,Maybe you better see for yourself.,6
MULDER,Sheriff Arens is outside. They're still pulling bones from the river.,11
SCULLY,"Well, so far I’ve been able to isolate nine distinct skeletons. This one belonged to the late George Kearns.",19
MULDER,How do you know?,4
SCULLY,"The pin in his femur. According to his medical file, Kearns broke his right leg four years ago.",18
MULDER,What about the others?,4
SCULLY,"Well. I'll need more sophisticated equipment to be certain, but I estimate that some of these bones are as much as 20 or 30 years old. All of them share one strange detail, though.",34
MULDER,"Well, they seem to have lost their heads.",8
SCULLY,"Well, besides that. The older bones show signs of decay and surface abrasion just like you'd expect but for some reason all of them, even Kearns’s, are smooth and buffed at the ends.",33
MULDER,It’s almost like they’ve been polished.,6
SCULLY,"It could be from erosion from the water, but...",9
MULDER,No. That water had hardly any current and this level of erosion wouldn't be confined to just the ends of the bones.,22
SCULLY,Any theories?,2
MULDER,Maybe.,1
DORIS,Sheriff Arens?,2
SHERIFF ARENS,Doris.,1
DORIS,Is it true? Just tell me.,6
SHERIFF ARENS,"Doris, I want you to listen to me.",8
DORIS,"They found him, didn't they?",5
SHERIFF ARENS,"Well, we brought up quite a few remains at the river this afternoon and George’s were among them. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.",23
DORIS,No... No!,2
SHERIFF ARENS,"It’s gonna be all right. Don’t worry, Doris. We’ll take care of you. Doris? Doris!",15
JESS HAROLD,That the new schedule?,4
JESS HAROLD,Why do I get the feeling you're not here to check up on my neck?,15
DR. RANDOLPH,They found bones in the river.,6
JESS HAROLD,I know. I heard.,4
DR. RANDOLPH,Did you also hear that Clayton Walsh came down with the symptoms? That's four. It's getting worse with every day that goes by.,23
JESS HAROLD,Someone has to tell Mr. Chaco.,6
DR. RANDOLPH,He knows what’s happening. He’s just not doing anything about it.,11
JESS HAROLD,Maybe I should talk to him.,6
DR. RANDOLPH,You can try.,3
JESS HAROLD,I will talk to him. He'll listen to me.,9
DR. RANDOLPH,And if he doesn't?,4
MULDER,"I had Danny run a check on all missing persons last seen within a 200- mile radius of Dudley. In the last 50 years, 87 people have disappeared near here and, judging from the forensic evidence, I’d say the same person or persons was responsible.",45
SCULLY,Then it may have been the work of some kind of a cult.,13
MULDER,"Scully, I think the good people of Dudley have been eating more than just chicken.",15
SCULLY,You think these people were eaten?,6
MULDER,Look at these bones. They've been polished at both ends suggesting they were boiled in a pot. Anthropologists have used similar evidence to prove cannibalism among the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico.,32
SCULLY,"Well, then Paula Gray may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jacob by eating George Kearns.",12
MULDER,That could begin to explain her youthful appearance.,8
SCULLY,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,Some cannibalistic rituals are enacted with a belief that they can prolong life.,13
SCULLY,Cannibalism is one thing but increasing longevity by eating human flesh...,11
MULDER,"Think about it, Scully. From vampirism to Catholicism, whether literally or symbolically, the reward for eating flesh is eternal life. I don’t claim to know how it works, but we both saw Paula Gray.",34
SCULLY,We never confirmed the date of birth on her personnel file.,11
MULDER,The records at the courthouse should tell us how old she really is and if anybody else in Dudley is lying about their age. You coming?,26
JESS HAROLD,"You’ve got to do something about what’s happening, Mr. Chaco. People are getting scared. They don't know what to make of things.",22
CHACO,They're losing their faith is what it sounds like.,9
JESS HAROLD,It's getting hard to hold on to the way things are going. Three more have gotten sick since yesterday.,19
CHACO,"I lost my granddaughter in this, Jess, so don't tell me what we're up against. Now, I said I’ll handle it.",21
JESS HAROLD,I know you did....,4
DORIS,I need to see Mr. Chaco.,6
CHACO,Doris?,1
DORIS,"I... I can't do this anymore, Mr. Chaco. I can't keep lying.",12
CHACO,It's all right. Jess told me what happened. You have nothing to worry about.,14
DORIS,They're gonna think I did it.,6
CHACO,No. They won't think any such thing.,7
DORIS,But I did. I helped!,5
CHACO,"No. He was no good, Doris. He had no values. He didn't fit in here.",15
DORIS,But he was my husband.,5
CHACO,"That was a price you had to pay. Now, you knew that from the beginning.",15
DORIS,But those FBI agents...,4
CHACO,"Ah-ah. This town wasn't built in a day. It's not about to fall apart in a day. You're a part of us now and we're going to take good care of you. Now I want you to go home, get some rest. You've got a funeral to go to. This whole thing will blow over soon enough and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.",66
DORIS,I’m sorry.,2
CHACO,"That's all right. We all understand, Doris. Good night.",9
CHACO,She'll be fine.,3
JESS HAROLD,She's not stable.,3
CHACO,"She's one of us now, part of our town.",9
JESS HAROLD,Unless we do something about her there won't be any town left to speak of.,15
CHACO,No! No. Once we start turning on ourselves we're no better than the animals. It's the FBI we should be worried about. They're the real problem.,26
MULDER,Someone’s been playing with matches.,5
SCULLY,Smells like a recent fire.,5
MULDER,I bet it’s no coincidence it only hit the birth records.,11
SCULLY,You think someone was expecting us?,6
MULDER,Mulder.,1
DORIS,It’s Doris Kearns. I’m in my house. I need to speak with you right away.,15
MULDER,Are you all right?,4
DORIS,I'm afraid for my life. I’m afraid he’ll kill me.,10
MULDER,Who?,1
DORIS,Mr. Chaco.,2
MULDER,"All right, Mrs. Kearns, I want you to stay in the house and lock the door and don’t answer the door until Agent Scully gets there.",26
SCULLY,Where are you going?,4
MULDER,To take Chaco into custody.,5
SCULLY,Mrs. Kearns?! Mrs. Kearns?!,4
SCULLY,Mrs. Kearns?,2
MULDER,Is Mr. Chaco in?,4
HOUSEKEEPER,I'll see if he's still awake.,6
HOUSEKEEPER,"I’m sorry, but Mr. Chaco is unable to see you now.",11
MULDER,Do you know what's in here?,6
HOUSEKEEPER,I wouldn't know.,3
MULDER,Can you open it?,4
HOUSEKEEPER,I don't have the key.,5
HOUSEKEEPER,What do you think you're doing?,6
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"Scully, Chaco’s not here.",4
SCULLY,"Yeah, Mrs. Kearns is missing too, Mulder. I think someone’s been here. The power was cut and the back door was wide open when I got here. But her car is still out back.",34
MULDER,Chaco must have taken her.,5
MULDER,Scully? Scully! Scully! What happened? Scully! Are you there?,9
MULDER,Are you all right? Answer me! SCULLY!!,7
CHACO,What have you done here? I warned you. I said not to touch her. Doris Kearns was one of us.! Who's behind this?,23
CHACO,"Why didn't you listen to me? It's the outsiders we have to deal with, not one of our own.",19
JESS HAROLD,We'll deal with them all.,5
CHACO,Look at yourselves. Look at what you've become. This isn't faith anymore it's just fear. They've turned us into an abomination.,21
JESS HAROLD,You brought in the outsider who made us sick.,9
CHACO,Once you turn on yourselves it's over. How long before it's any one of us? Any one of you?,19
JESS HAROLD,"That's not your problem anymore, Mr. Chaco.",7
CHACO,No.,1
CHACO,Kill me... And you kill us all.,7
JESS HAROLD,Bring her over.,3
MULDER,Are you hurt?,3
SCULLY,Mm-Mm.,1
MULDER,You all right?,3
SCULLY,"Pending further review, the Chaco processing plant has been closed by the USDA. So far, no evidence of contaminated chicken has been discovered. Though it remains unknown how many citizens participated in the ritual activity, 27 have become fatally ill with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. What is known is that a transport plane carrying Walter Chaco was shot down in 1944 over New Guinea. Chaco was the only survivor of that crash. According to naval records, he spent six months with the Jole -- a tribe whose cannibalistic practices have long been suspected but never proven. Naval records also show that Walter Chaco was born in 1902 making him 93 years old at the time of his death. As of this date, his remains still have not been found.",126
