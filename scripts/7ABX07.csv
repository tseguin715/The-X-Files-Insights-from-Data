REVEREND ORISON,"God's love will set us free. And I believe... if I pray for that love... if I get down on my knees...... and allow God to enter my hardened, lonely miserable heart and change me through and through... that miracle... will come. Now, who here believes that with me? Do you? Do you?",53
BRIGHAM,"Yes, sir, I believe it.",5
REVEREND ORISON,"Do you? Well, believe, because God's love is not just some slogan. It's a promise straight to you from the Lord Almighty Himself. A promise paid for with the blood of his only begotten son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. All you have to do... is believe.",46
PRISONERS,Amen!,1
REVEREND ORISON,"God's love will set you free. Now, doesn't that just lift up your heart and make you want to say Glory! Amen!",22

BRIGHAM,Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen...,12
GUARD,"You believe that, Donnie? God loves a sack of crap like you?",12
DONNIE PFASTER,Bible says.,2
GUARD,"Bible says you kill women, cut their pinkies.",8
BRIGHAM,Glory. Amen.,2
GUARD,You're going to burn in hell,6
BRIGHAM,Glory. Amen.,2
GUARD,"You listening to me? God's got a place for you, all right. Sick puke.",14
DONNIE PFASTER,Then where does that leave you?,6
GUARD,Sorry. Just not good enough for the Illinois penal system.,10
BRIGHAM,My hands! My hands!,4
MARSHALL DADDO,Life without chance of parole for the premeditated and sadistic sexual murders of five Twin Cities women in 1994. Donald Addie Pfaster. You two put this man away.,28
MULDER,Yeah. Someone forgot to throw away the key.,8
MARSHALL DADDO,"Ah, well, that's another story. Right now, we have to apprehend this man. We'd use all the help you can give us in understanding exactly who it is we're after.",30
MULDER,"Donnie Pfaster is a death fetishist-- a collector of bone and dead flesh, of toenails and hair. It's what floats his boat, gets him off.",25
MARSHALL DADDO,He's a sick man.,4
MULDER,Sick would describe him. We found women's fingers in his freezer. He liked to eat them with his peas and carrots.,21
MARSHALL DADDO,So it's just women he's after?,6
MULDER,Just women. Been five years in here thinking about only that. I'm sure he's worked up quite an appetite.,19
MARSHALL DADDO,"I happen to know you two agents have a particular forte-- a thing for... what is it called? The supernatural? Now, the circumstances of the escape...",26
SCULLY,I promise you there is nothing supernatural about this man. Donnie Pfaster is just plain evil.,16
MUSIC,Don't look any further Don't look any further Someone to count on In a world ever changing,17
MULDER,Case closed.,2
MUSIC,"Here I am, baby",4
MULDER,"Didn't look at the file, did you?",7
SCULLY,A man escaped from prison.,5
MULDER,"Not a man. Donnie Pfaster. And he didn't just escape, he walked out. He walked out of a maximum security facility and no one seems to know how he did it.",31
SCULLY,Isn't that why we're here?,5
MULDER,"That's why I'm here. I don't know about you. Why are you here? Go home, Scully.",16
SCULLY,"Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.",6
MULDER,The man abducted you. Donnie Pfaster did a number on your head like I've never seen and it's okay... to walk away.,22
SCULLY,"Mulder, that man does things to people that no one should ever have to think about. It's not a question of if I should stay. I don't have a choice. So let's get to work.",35
MULDER,"Well, this isn't the first incident. Two prisoners have escaped from maximum security facilities in neighboring states over the past year.",21
SCULLY,6:06? And what's so supernatural about that?,7
MULDER,"Dozens of witnesses, guards, and staff, and no one seems to remember anything. For a while, they didn't even know these guys were missing.",24
SCULLY,Have they been apprehended?,4
MULDER,"No, neither of the men have ever been seen again.",10
BRIGHAM,I already told the Warden everything I know... everything I saw that day.,13
MULDER,"Yes, but I'm still a little confused. Maybe you could go over it again.",14
BRIGHAM,I'm a Christian man.,4
MULDER,Then I know you'll tell me the truth.,8
BRIGHAM,"Yeah, but I got no idea about Donnie Pfaster....... or how he broke out.",14
MULDER,You and Donnie Pfaster were in the garment shop at or about the time he disappeared.,16
BRIGHAM,"Well, it wasn't just me. I mean, there was a lot of us in the shop.",16
MULDER,"Yeah, but you had something happen. You had an incident.",10
BRIGHAM,Yeah. Something like that.,4
MULDER,You cried out to the guards that you'd cut your hands.,11
BRIGHAM,"My fingers, man. I saw them all cut off.",9
MULDER,"Others saw them, too.",4
BRIGHAM,"No, but I felt them cut off.",7
MULDER,How do you explain that?,5
BRIGHAM,"God works in mysterious ways, brother.",6
BRIGHAM,Glory. Amen.,2
BRIGHAM,Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.,4
MULDER,Post-hypnotic suggestion. Did you see him?,6
SCULLY,"You mean, did I see him raise his foot? Yes, I saw that.",13
MULDER,"A programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion in this case, a rhythmic motion of the hands producing a unconscious act in a conscious state.",25
MULDER,Doesn't work on you.,4
SCULLY,"I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.",6
MULDER,Group hypnosis.,2
SCULLY,If you're suggesting that Donnie Pfaster escaped from prison using a technique from a Vegas lounge act I'd think again.,20
MULDER,Mesmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences.,9
SCULLY,"So, how would Donnie have acquired this amazing ability?",9
MULDER,I'm not saying that it was Donnie.,7
SCULLY,"Well, then, who?",3
MULDER,"Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons. One man has had possible contact with each of those cons. The prison chaplain. Glory. Amen. Not God, the chaplain. Scully, what?",30
SCULLY,That song-- can you hear that?,6
MUSIC,Someone to count on,4
MULDER,Barely.,1
MUSIC,"Here I am, stop where you're standing...",7
SCULLY,I haven't heard that song since high school. That's the second time I've heard it in the last hour.,19
MULDER,"Well, I think if it was a make out song I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?",18
MUSIC,"Oh, babe, don't look any further",6
BLUEBERRY,Looking for something to eat?,5
DONNIE PFASTER,Me?,1
BLUEBERRY,How about today's special?,4
BLUEBERRY,"You aren't a narc, are you?",6
DONNIE PFASTER,No.,1
BLUEBERRY,You're looking at my hands.,5
DONNIE PFASTER,You need a buff and polish.,6
BLUEBERRY,What are you? A freak?,5
DONNIE PFASTER,I... I just got out of prison.,7
WAITRESS,"Hey, Missy. Leave the customers alone!",6
DONNIE PFASTER,I'll do it for free.,5
BLUEBERRY,You just got out of prison and you want to give me a manicure?,14
DONNIE PFASTER,I'll even do your cuticles.,5
REVEREND ORISON,You receive the Lord's grace and this is your thanks?,10
DONNIE PFASTER,What?,1
REVEREND ORISON,Who do you think got you out of prison?,9
DONNIE PFASTER,I don't care. I'm busy right now.,7
REVEREND ORISON,The Grace of God got you out and it's the only thing that will keep you out.,17
BLUEBERRY,I thought you were kidding.,5
REVEREND ORISON,"He's chosen you, Donnie.",4
BLUEBERRY,Later.,1
DONNIE PFASTER,You called them on me.,5
REVEREND ORISON,No.,1
DONNIE PFASTER,Then do something.,3
REVEREND ORISON,I have a car.,4
DONNIE PFASTER,We aren't going to make it to the car.,9
REVEREND ORISON,It's within His power.,4
REVEREND ORISON,"Glory, amen. Glory, amen.",4
MULDER,Was he here?,3
MARSHALL DADDO,"Well, um... We're trying to determine that.",7
SCULLY,Did you see him?,4
MARSHALL DADDO,"Well, that's a good question. We thought we saw something, but apparently we didn't.",14
MULDER,We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect.,11
MULDER,"Well, something happened here, huh?",5
WAITRESS,Guy got hit by a car.,6
MARSHALL DADDO,"A prison chaplain, it turns out. A Reverend Orison. Paramedics took him to the hospital.",15
MUSIC,Someone to count on,4
MARSHALL DADDO,He's in pretty bad shape.,5
MUSIC,"In a world ever changing Here I am, stop...",9
SCULLY,"Excuse me, uh, could you turn that up, please?",9
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MUSIC,"What you need is a lover Someone to take over Oh, girl Don't look any further And it's strange When you think of the chances...",25
SCULLY,"You're lucky to be alive, Reverend Orison.",7
REVEREND ORISON,Who are you?,3
SCULLY,Special Agent Dana Scully.,4
REVEREND ORISON,"Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully. He believes in you.",10
SCULLY,That's nice... But my partner and I are more concerned with several disappearances from maximum-security facilities that seem to involve you.,21
REVEREND ORISON,Don't be concerned. God has them.,6
SCULLY,What do you mean? Reverend?,5
REVEREND ORISON,"You're a Believer, aren't you?",5
SCULLY,"This has nothing to do with me, sir.",8
REVEREND ORISON,It has everything to do with you. You have faith... have had faith. You hear Him calling you but you're unsure what to do.,24
SCULLY,"It's not exactly a long shot, sir.",7
REVEREND ORISON,"You stand as you do now, neither here nor there... longing... but afraid, waiting for a sign. But the signs are everywhere.",22
SCULLY,"What happened to the inmates, sir?",6
REVEREND ORISON,"Everything has a reason, Scout. Everything on God's earth. Every moment of every day the Devil waits for but an instant. As it is, it has always been. The Devil's instant is our eternity.",34
MULDER,"The Good Reverend. How do you do? Or maybe I should say, ""How do you do it?""",17
REVEREND ORISON,His is the Word. I am but the Messenger who delivers it.,12
MULDER,"Well, this delivery arrived a little late-- a little late and a little cold as a matter of fact. I thought you'd want to see it.",26
REVEREND ORISON,What is this?,3
MULDER,"Blood of the lamb, Reverend. Handiwork of Mr. Donnie Pfaster-- a young girl he picked up at the bus stop.",20
REVEREND ORISON,"Oh, Lord.",2
MULDER,"Where is he, Reverend?",4
REVEREND ORISON,He took my car. She wasn't supposed to die.,9
MULDER,No. Donnie was supposed to die. You were supposed to kill him. That's why you freed him. God knows you're capable of it. The Reverend Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison-- convicted in 1959 of first degree murder. Served 22 years in Soledad.,43
REVEREND ORISON,God spoke to me. He told me to look after Donnie.,11
MULDER,"When God spoke to you, Reverend, did He happen to mention where Donnie was headed?",15
SCULLY,"Where are you going, Mulder?",5
MULDER,To prove that man's a liar.,6
SCULLY,How do you prove that somebody isn't being directed by God? You don't believe that it happens?,17
MULDER,"God is a spectator, Scully. He just reads the box scores.",11
SCULLY,I don't believe that.,4
MULDER,You think God directs that man? You think He directs him to kill?,13
SCULLY,"Donnie Pfaster isn't dead, and we don't know that the other inmates who escaped are dead, either.",17
MULDER,"So, what? You think that God directs him to... let the prisoners out to kill?",15
SCULLY,"No, but I believe that the Reverend believes what he's saying-- that's it's God working through him.",17
MULDER,"Well, plenty of nut bags do. Has he ever spoken to you?",12
SCULLY,I'm trying not to take offense.,6
MULDER,What did he say?,4
SCULLY,"Mulder, I have heard that song three times now. That may not mean anything to you but it means something to me.",22
MULDER,What does it mean?,4
SCULLY,I never thought about it before. It never meant anything to me until yesterday when it made me remember something.,20
MULDER,What?,1
SCULLY,When I was thirteen my father was stationed in San Diego. I was listening to the radio to that song when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday School teacher had been killed.,36
MULDER,Hmm...,1
SCULLY,"He had been murdered in his front yard... And that's the first time that I ever felt that there was real evil in the world. Mulder, Reverend Orison called me ""Scout."" That's the same name that my Sunday School exactly the same time that I woke up yesterday morning when my power went out.",54
MULDER,"So, what do you think that God is telling you?",10
MULDER,"Well, all right. Come with me, Scout. I'll show you how the Reverend talks to God.",16
REPORTER,"Police are involved in a four-state manhunt for a prisoner who escaped maximum security in Marion, Illinois. He was last seen driving a green 1970 Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top. He is described as six feet tall, medium build...",41
MULDER,It's a cerebral edema.,4
SCULLY,Swelling of the brain-- a trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident.,16
MULDER,"Except this isn't accidental. The cause, in fact, as it was stated to me is self-inflicted. There's a small hole here in the skull which allows oxygen into the brain cavity, the result of which is the Reverend Orison has three times the normal blood volume pumping through his brain.",50
SCULLY,And he did this himself?,5
MULDER,Yeah. My guess is he-he probably did it when he first got into prison-- when he first learned how to use its powers.,23
SCULLY,"""Its powers.""",2
MULDER,"There's a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities are limited only by inadequate blood supply. In fact, centuries ago, in the Peruvian Andes, Holy Men used to physically remove parts of their skulls in order to increase blood volume or drill small holes.",48
SCULLY,So this hole in his head enables Reverend Orison to help these prisoners escape?,14
MULDER,"The practitioners of this found that they could perform certain mental tricks one of which they called ""stopping the world.""",20
SCULLY,"Well, nobody can stop the world, Mulder. I don't care how many holes they have in their head.",18
MULDER,"Yeah, but maybe they can alter perception of it creating a disparate version of reality which they can then project through hypnosis.",22
SCULLY,"But why? I mean, even if he could, why?",9
MULDER,Donnie Pfaster is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. That's the final judgment as far as society is concerned but not in the eyes of God or in the eyes of a man who thinks he's God's tool.,40
SCULLY,"Well, then, if Reverend Orison meant to kill Donnie Pfaster then why is he still alive?",16
MULDER,I don't know. Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn't control. Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception but then unwittingly he... opened the gates of Hell.,30
MARSHAL,What?,1
REVEREND ORISON,Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.,6
LADY IN RED,Are you Donald?,3
DONNIE PFASTER,Yes.,1
LADY IN RED,I'm from Tip-Top Gentlemen's Service.,5
LADY IN RED,"This isn't your place, is it?",6
DONNIE PFASTER,No. Why?,2
LADY IN RED,"'Cause I was coming up the stairs and got stopped by the landlord-- like it's any of his business. He told me some Reverend Orison lives here. Now, you ain't no preacher, are you?",34
DONNIE PFASTER,No.,1
LADY IN RED,Good. They always like the weirdest things. You know what I mean?,12
LADY IN RED,You okay?,2
DONNIE PFASTER,Yes.,1
LADY IN RED,Something you want to say?,5
DONNIE PFASTER,Love your hair.,3
LADY IN RED,What are you doing?,4
DONNIE PFASTER,Is your hair chemically treated?,5
LADY IN RED,My hair?,2
DONNIE PFASTER,I don't know which product to use.,7
LADY IN RED,"You're not using no product-- I'm clean, my hair's clean, if you're going to be that weird about it I ought to just leave.",24
DONNIE PFASTER,I'm being a gentleman.,4
LADY IN RED,"Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel. I'm going to get out of here.",16
DONNIE PFASTER,It's a wig. They lied to me. You lied to me!,11
SCULLY,Where did he go?,4
MULDER,Marshal?,1
MULDER,Marshal?,1
MARSHAL,What?,1
SCULLY,The prisoner... the man you were guarding in this room. What happened to him?,14
MULDER,"He's gone, Scully, so's the Marshal's gun.",7
SCULLY,You didn't see him?,4
MULDER,"Let's go, Scully.",3
MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,What does this mean?,4
MULDER,Did you tell him?,4
SCULLY,"No, I only told you.",5
MULDER,"Oh, he must have... overheard us when we were talking in the hallway.",13
SCULLY,I didn't mention the name of the song.,8
MULDER,I'm sure you did.,4
SCULLY,"No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.",6
MULDER,Well... maybe this was meant for you. Don't look any further.,11
REVEREND ORISON,Whosoever shedeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.,11
DONNIE PFASTER,What are you doing?,4
REVEREND ORISON,Taking you home. The wicked... will be punished.,8
REVEREND ORISON,"Pray for God's love, Donnie. Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart. All you have to do is believe. Repent. You'll feel God's love come to show you the way to His heavenly kingdom.",38
REVEREND ORISON,Are you sorry for what you've done?,7
DONNIE PFASTER,You...,1
REVEREND ORISON,What did you say?,4
DONNIE PFASTER,Never... No... No...,3
REVEREND ORISON,Why are you crying?,4
DONNIE PFASTER,I can't... I can't...,4
REVEREND ORISON,"Beg His forgiveness for what you did to those girls. For what you did to all those poor, helpless girls.",20
DONNIE PFASTER,My violence is always waiting... for an instant. For when His back is turned. You can see it now.,19
REVEREND ORISON,Are you crying for your sins? Or for yourself?,9
DONNIE PFASTER,"No, Reverend. I cry for you. Because you cannot kill me.",11
MULDER,"You know, it's funny, when all is said and done, there's... not much mystery in murder.",16
SCULLY,"And for that I owe you an apology, Mulder.",9
MULDER,What do you mean?,4
SCULLY,"Well, you were right. I was looking too hard for connections that weren't there. Orison was a murderer, plain and simple. He liberated those prisoners so he could bring them out here and pass judgment on them.",37
MULDER,"I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God. Glory, Amen. Let's go home, Scully.",20
SCULLY,"You know, Donnie Pfaster placed the call to the police that led us out here. It's almost like he's begging us to hunt him down.",25
MULDER,"This X-File is over... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself. Let's let the US Marshals take over from here. Don't look any further, Scully.",27
MULDER,This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message after the... .,9
MARSHALL DADDO,"Agent Mulder, Marshall Joe Daddo in Marion. Just talked to a call girl who i.d.'d Donnie Pfaster as an attacker. Claims Pfaster got real upset when she was wearing a red wig. Upset she wasn't a redhead. This mean anything to you? Appreciate a call back.",46
SCULLY,Go back to hell!,4
DONNIE PFASTER,"Who does your nails, girly girl?",6
SCULLY,Let me go! The only reason why you're alive is because I asked the judge for life! The only reason why you're alive is because we didn't kill you when we could!,32
DONNIE PFASTER,You're the one that got away. You're all I think about.,11
SCULLY,I'm a federal agent. You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time.,19
DONNIE PFASTER,I'm going to run you a bath.,7
MUSIC,"Don't look any further Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o...",10
DONNIE PFASTER,"Now, be good and don't cause me any problems.",9
MUSIC,"Ooh Oh, whoa, whoa Oh Someone to count on In a world ever changin' Here I am Stop where your standin'",21
MUSIC,"What you need is a lover Someone to take over Oh, girl Don't look any further And it's strange When you think of the chances That we've both been in a state of mind Too cool to be careless Lookin' for the right thing",44
MUSIC,"Oh, baby Don't look any further Tonight We're gonna take a trip to paradise Rockin' all night long Baby Daylight Daylight I'll still be lookin' in your heavenly eyes And we'll go on and on",35
MUSIC,"Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o Don't look any further Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o Don't look any further",20
MUSIC,"Someone to count on In a world ever changing Here I am, baby Stop right where you're standing What you need is a lover Someone to take over Here I am, babe Don't look any further, further...",37
MULDER,Excuse me.,2
COP,Yeah. Sure.,2
MULDER,"If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.",13
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,You can't judge yourself.,4
SCULLY,Maybe I don't have to.,5
MULDER,The Bible allows for vengeance.,5
SCULLY,But the law doesn't.,4
MULDER,The way I see it... he didn't give you a choice. And my report will reflect that... in case you're worried. Donnie Pfaster would've surely killed again if given the chance.,31
SCULLY,"He was evil, Mulder. I'm sure about that, without a doubt. But there's one thing that I'm not sure of.",20
MULDER,What's that?,2
SCULLY,Who was at work in me. Or what... what made me... what made me pull the trigger.,17
MULDER,You mean if it was God?,6
SCULLY,I mean... what if it wasn't?,6
