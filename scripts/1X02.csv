MRS. USHER,"Hi, you're reached the Usher residence, please leave a message at the tone, thank you.",15
MR USHER,"Hi honey, it's about 8:30 and erm, I'm gonna be here for a while. The presentation didn't go so well, call me, I love you, bye.",26
TOM COLTON,Guess who I ran into from our class at Quantico? Marty Neill.,12
SCULLY,J. Edgar Jr?,3
TOM COLTON,"Just got bumped up, Foreign Counter Intelligence, New York City Bureau, Supervisory, Special Agent.",14
SCULLY,Supervisory?,1
TOM COLTON,That's right.,2
SCULLY,"Two years out of the academy, how'd he land that?",10
TOM COLTON,Lucked into the World Trade Center bombing.,7
SCULLY,"Well, good for Marty.",4
TOM COLTON,"Oh, come on Dana, the guy is a loser, look where he is now. That's where we should be.",19
SCULLY,"Brad Wilson told me, the pyshological profile you wrote on the Washington Crossing Killer led them straight to the suspect. Word has it, you're on the Violent Crime Section's fast track.",31
TOM COLTON,So how are you doing? Have you had any close encounters of the third kind?,15
SCULLY,Is that what everyone thinks I do?,7
TOM COLTON,"No, of course not. But you do work with Spooky Mulder.",11
SCULLY,Mulder's ideas maybe a bit out there but he is a great agent.,13
TOM COLTON,"Yeah, well, I've got this case that's, out there. Baltimore PD cops, they want our help on a serial killer profile. Three murders began six weeks ago, victims vary in age, race, gender, no known connections to each other.",39
SCULLY,I take it there's a pattern?,6
TOM COLTON,"Point of entry. Actually, the lack of one.",8
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
TOM COLTON,"One victim, college girl, killed in her ten by twelve center block dorm room. She was found with the windows locked and the door chained from the inside. The last incident, two days ago, high security office building, nothing on the security monitors, janitor spoke to the victim minutes before the murder, didn't hear or see a thing out of the ordinary.",62
SCULLY,Suicides?,1
TOM COLTON,"Each victim was found with their liver, ripped out. No cutting tools used.",13
SCULLY,Bare hands. This looks like an X-file.,7
TOM COLTON,"Let's not get carried away. I'm gonna solve these murders but, what I would like from you is, to go over the case histories. Maybe, come down to the crime scene.",31
SCULLY,Do you want me to ask Mulder?,7
TOM COLTON,"Ok, if he wants to come and do you a favor, great. But make sure he knows this is my case. Dana, if I can break a case like this one, I'll be getting my bump up the ladder. And you, maybe you won't have to be Mrs. Spooky anymore.",50
MULDER,So why didn't they ask me?,6
SCULLY,"They're friends of mine from the academy, I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.",17
MULDER,Why would I make them so uncomfortable?,7
SCULLY,It probably has to do with your reputation.,8
MULDER,Reputation? I have a reputation?,5
SCULLY,"Mulder, look. Colton plays by the book and you don't. They feel your methods, your theories are...",17
MULDER,Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky?,6
VOICE,Agent Scully's in here sir.,5
TOM COLTON,"Dana, sorry I'm late.",4
SCULLY,"We just got here. Er, Fox Mulder, Tom Colton.",9
TOM COLTON,"So, Mulder, what do you think, does this look like the work of little green men?",16
MULDER,Grey.,1
TOM COLTON,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,"Grey. You said green men, a Reticulan skin tone is actually grey, they're notorious for their extraction of terrestrial human livers. Due to iron depletion in the Reticulan galaxy.",29
TOM COLTON,You can't be serious.,4
MULDER,Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula? `scuse me.,15
TOM COLTON,"Dana, I've been thinking about this and I have a theory, might explain alot, tell me what you think. What if the guy enters... Hold on a second. What in the hell's he doing? Err, that vent is six inches by about eighteen, even if a Reticulan could crawl through, it's screwed in place.",54
MULDER,"This is the print I took yesterday from Usher's office, these others are from an X-file. Ten murders, Baltimore area, undetermined points of entry, each victim had their liver removed. These prints were discovered at five of the ten crime scenes.",41
SCULLY,"Ten murders, Colton never mentioned..",5
MULDER,"Most likely, he's not aware of them. These two prints were lifted five years before he was born at Powhatan Mill. And these three were lifted probably, five years before his mother was even born.",35
SCULLY,"Are you saying, these prints are from the 1960's and the 1930's?",12
MULDER,"And fingerprinting was just coming into it's own in 1903, but there was a murder involving an extracted liver.",19
SCULLY,Of course.,2
MULDER,Now that's five murders every thirty years. That makes two more to go this year.,15
SCULLY,You're saying these are copy-cats.,5
MULDER,"What did we learn in our first day at the academy, Scully? Each fingerprint is unique, these are a perfect match.",21
SCULLY,Are you suggesting that I go before the Violent Crime Section and present a profile declaring that these murders were done by aliens?,23
MULDER,"No, of course not, I find no evidence of alien involvement.",11
SCULLY,"Well, what then? That, that this is the work of a hundred year old serial killer who is capable of overpowering a healthy six foot two businessman.",27
MULDER,And he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch fingers.,12
SCULLY,"Look, bottom line, this is Colton's case.",7
MULDER,"Our X-file dates back to 1903, we had it first.",10
SCULLY,"Mulder, they don't want you involved. They don't want to hear your theories. That's why Blevins has you hidden away down here.",22
MULDER,"You're down here too. Look, why don't we agree to this, they'll have their investigation, we'll have ours and never the twain shall meet. Agreed?",25
FULLER,"Good job, Agent Scully. If there are no objections, I'd like to begin our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight. We're looking for a male, twenty-five to thirty-five, possibly wearing a uniform, gas company, UPS, whatever. I know you're assigned to another area Scully, but if you don't mind some overtime, you're welcome to come aboard with us, on this. Erm, that is if you don't mind working in an area that's a bit more down-to-earth.",76
WALKIE-TALKIE,"Position ten, do you check?",5
SCULLY,"Position ten, I copy.",4
MULDER,"You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would ya copper?",9
SCULLY,"Mulder, what the hell are you doing here?",8
MULDER,"He's not coming back here, his thrill is derived from the challenge of unseemingly impossible entry. He's already beaten this place, if you'd read the X-file on the case, you'd come to the same conclusion.",35
SCULLY,"Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.",6
MULDER,"Seeds? You're wasting your time, I'm going home. Scully, call for backup and get over here.",16
SCULLY,Position ten requesting backup.,4
MULDER,In there.,2
SCULLY,"Federal Agent, I'm armed. Proceed down the vent, slowly.",9
TOM COLTON,Take `im.,2
AGENT,"Alright, move, move, move.",4
AGENT 2,FBI.,1
AGENT,"Don't move, don't move, get your hands up, keep `em up.",11
AGENT 2,You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent..,10
MULDER,You were right.,3
EXAMINER,"Is your full name, Eugene Victor Tooms?",7
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?,9
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,Are you an employee of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?,10
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,"Is it your intent to lie to me about anything here, today?",12
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Were you ever enrolled in college?,6
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,Were you ever enrolled in medical school?,7
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Have you ever removed a liver from a human being?,10
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Have you ever killed a living creature?,7
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,Have you ever killed a human being?,7
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Were you ever in George Usher's office?,7
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Did you kill George Usher?,5
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Are you over one hundred years old?,7
TOM COLTON,That must be a control question.,6
MULDER,I had her ask it.,5
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Have you ever been to Powhatan Mill?,7
EUGENE TOOMS,Yes.,1
EXAMINER,In 1933?,2
EUGENE TOOMS,No.,1
EXAMINER,Are you afraid you might fail this test?,8
EUGENE TOOMS,"Well, yes, because I didn't do anything.",7
EXAMINER,"He nailed it, A plus, as far as I'm concerned, the subject did not kill those two people.",18
FULLER,"Maintenance people at the office building, confirm the call to animal control regarding a bad smell. They found a dead cat, in the ventilation ducts on the second floor.",29
TOM COLTON,"Well, that's that.",3
SCULLY,It still doesn't explain what he was doing there that late at night.,13
FULLER,"So, he's one of the few civil servants we have with initiative, and we busted him for it.",18
SCULLY,"He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting security.",12
TOM COLTON,"Dana, he passed the test, his story checks out, he's not the guy. It doesn't mean that your profile's incorrect.",20
MULDER,"Scully's right, it is the guy.",6
FULLER,"Whatta you got, Mulder?",4
MULDER,"He lied on questions eleven and thirteen, his electrodermal and cardiographic response nearly go off the chart.",17
FULLER,"Is number eleven, the hundred year old question? Well, let me tell ye, I had a reaction to that stupid question. And what the hell is this Powhatan Mill thing.",30
MULDER,"Two murders with matching mo's occurred in Powhatan Mill in 1933, just look at the chart.",16
EXAMINER,My interpretation of those reactions..,5
FULLER,"I don't need you or that machine, telling me if Tooms was alive in `33.",15
MULDER,He's the guy.,3
FULLER,I'm letting him go.,4
TOM COLTON,You comin'?,2
SCULLY,"Tom, I wanna thank you for letting me put in some time with the VCS, but I am officially assigned to the X-files.",23
TOM COLTON,I'll see what I can do about that.,8
SCULLY,"Tom, I can look out for myself.",7
TOM COLTON,"You said Mulder was out there, that guy's insane.",9
SCULLY,"You knew they wouldn't believe you, why did you push it?",11
MULDER,"Maybe I thought you caught the right guy. And maybe I run into so many people, who are hostile, just because they can't open their minds to the possibilties, that sometimes the need to mess with their heads, outweighs the millstone of humiliation.",43
SCULLY,"It seems like you were acting very territorial, I don't know, forget it.",13
MULDER,"Of course I was, in our investigations, you may not always agree with me but at least you respect the journey. And if you wanna continue working with them, I won't hold it against ye.",35
SCULLY,"Er, I don't know, you must have something more than your polygraph interpretation to backup this bizarre theory and I have to see what it is.",26
MULDER,"These are Eugene Tooms' prints. This is the fingerprint they took from Usher's office, it matches the old ones from the X-files. Obviously no match, but what if, somehow...",29
SCULLY,How could that be?,4
MULDER,"Only thing I know for certain is, they let him go.",11
FULLER,Sixty-four inches from the south wall.,6
TOM COLTON,"Let's run a check on liver transplants in the next twenty-four hours, maybe this thing is black market.",18
FULLER,"C'mon, it was ripped outta there.",6
TOM COLTON,"Look at this point, I'm willing to give any theory a shot. Any sane theory, I'm sorry Dana but I only want qualified members of the investigating team at the crime scene.",32
MULDER,"What's the matter Colton, you worried I'm gonna solve your case?",11
SCULLY,Tom. We have authorized access to this crime scene. A report of you obstructing another officer's investigation might stick out on your personnel file.,24
TOM COLTON,"Look Dana, whose side are you on?",7
SCULLY,The victim's.,2
FULLER,A hundred and five inches from the fireplace.,8
SCULLY,"The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white..",8
MULDER,It's Tooms. And he took something.,6
SCULLY,"Baltimore PD checked out Tooms' apartment, it was a cover. No one has ever lived there and he hasn't shown up for work since he was arrested.",27
MULDER,"I found him. How do we learn about the present, we look to the past. I think this is where it all began in 1903 on Exeter Street. Now look at the address of that first murder in 1903.",39
SCULLY,Apartment 2 0 3. He killed the guy above him.,10
MULDER,"Maybe, his neighbour played the victrola too loud.",8
SCULLY,"Well, this must be Tooms' great grandfather.",7
MULDER,What about the prints?,4
SCULLY,"Genetics might explain the patterns, it also might explain the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours. It begins with one family member, who raises an offspring, who raises the next child.",29
MULDER,"So what is this, the Anti-Waltons.",6
SCULLY,"Well, what do you think?",5
MULDER,"I think what we have to do is track Eugene Tooms, there's four down and one to go this year. If we don't get him right now, the next chance is in year.....",33
SCULLY,2023.,1
MULDER,"And you're gonna be head of the bureau by then. So I think you have to go through the census, I'm gonna plough through this century's marriage, birth, death certificates, and... You have any dramamine on you by any chance cos, these things make me seasick. Anything?",47
SCULLY,"Nope, he disappeared off the face of the earth. You?",10
MULDER,"Never was born, never married, never died.",7
SCULLY,"At least in Baltimore County. No, I did find one thing though, erm, it's the current address of the investigating officer at the Powhatan Mill murders in 1933.",28
FRANK BRIGGS,I've waited twenty-five years for you.,6
SCULLY,Sir?,1
FRANK BRIGGS,"I called it quits, in 1968 after, fourty-five years as a cop. And those killings at Powhatan Mill. I was a sheriif then and, er, I'd seen my share of murders, bloody ones. But I could go home and, pitch a few baseballs to my kid and never give it a second thought, you gotta be able to do that. You'd go crazy, right. But those murders in Powhatan Mill, when I walked into that room, my heart, went cold, my hands, numbed. I could feel, IT.",87
MULDER,"Feel what, Frank?",3
FRANK BRIGGS,"When I first heard about the death camps in 1945, I remembered Powhatan Mill. When I see the kurds and the bosnians, that room is there, I tell ye. It's like all the horrible acts that humans are capable of, somehow, gave birth to some kind of, human monster. That's why I say I've been waiting for you. Aah, there's a box in the trunk here, get it for me, would you please. Now this, is all the evidence I've collected, officially and unofficially.",84
SCULLY,Unofficially?,1
FRANK BRIGGS,"I knew the murders in `63 were by the same, person as in `33. But by then, they had me on a desk, pushing papers and they wouldn't let me anywhere near the case.",34
SCULLY,A piece of the removed liver?,6
FRANK BRIGGS,"Yes, but you know, that's not the only trophy he took with him. Family members reported small personal affects missing in each case. A hairbrush in the Walters murder, a coffee mug in the Taylor murder.",36
MULDER,"Have you ever heard the name, Eugene Victor Tooms?",9
FRANK BRIGGS,"Humh, when they wouldn't bring me aboard in `63 I, I did some of my own work. I took, these surveillance pictures, this, is Tooms. Course, that was him thirty years ago. And this, is the apartment where he lived. It was located at..",44
MULDER,66 Exeter Street?,3
FRANK BRIGGS,"Right. That's it, right there.",5
SCULLY,Here's 103.,2
MULDER,"The old man was right, you can feel it.",9
SCULLY,There's nothing here.,3
MULDER,Check this out. What's down here?,6
SCULLY,I don't know. Let's find out. Just an old coal cellar.,11
MULDER,Somebody having a garage sale. This is the shape of Werner's mantel.,12
SCULLY,Frank said he collected trophies.,5
MULDER,Does he live in here?,5
SCULLY,It looks like the wall's deteriorating.,6
MULDER,"No, somebody made it. This is a nest, look, it's made out of rags and newspapers.",16
SCULLY,"This looks like the opening, think there's anything inside? Oh my God, Mulder, it's smells like, I think it's bile.",20
MULDER,Is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without betraying my cool exterior?,17
SCULLY,No one could live in this.,6
MULDER,"I don't think it's where he lives, I think it's where he hibernates.",13
SCULLY,Hibernates?,1
MULDER,"Just listen, what if some genetic mutation could allow a man to awaken every thirty years.",16
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for that period. What if Tooms is some kind of, twentieth century, genetic mutant.",24
SCULLY,"In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back.",12
MULDER,Well we're gonna need a surveillance team.,7
SCULLY,"Yeah, that'll take some fannagling.",5
MULDER,"Well you go down town and see what you can fannagle, I'll keep watch.",14
SCULLY,"Oh, wait, I'm snagged on something, oh, it's ok, I got it.",12
"66 EXETER ST., 11",30 A.M.,2
MULDER,It's about time.,3
KENNEDY,"So, who're we looking for again?",6
MULDER,"Eugene Tooms, he's unarmed but consider him dangerous. Scully and I'll be back to relieve you in eight hours if he doesn't show, right here.",25
KRAMER,"You got it, Spooky.",4
TOM COLTON,We have to talk.,4
SCULLY,I have to meet Mulder..,5
TOM COLTON,That's what we have to talk about. You're using two of my men to sit in front of a building that's been condemned for ten years?,26
SCULLY,It isn't in any way interferring with your investigation.,9
TOM COLTON,"When we first had lunch, I really looked forward to working with you, you were a good agent, but now after Mulder, I couldn't have you far enough away. Don't bother going down there, I had the stakeout called off.",40
SCULLY,You can't do that.,4
TOM COLTON,"No, I can't but my regional asat can, especially after I told them about the irresponsible waste in man hours. Auh-uh! Let me call Mulder, let me tell him the news.",31
SCULLY,Is this what it takes to climb the ladder Colton?,10
TOM COLTON,All the way to the top.,6
SCULLY,"Then I can't wait `til you fall off and land on your ass. This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.",23
"66 EXETER ST., 7",25 P.M.,2
MULDER,"Where is everyone? Scully? This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.",14
SCULLY,"Mulder, you must've gone out since Colton gave us the night off, I say we file a complaint against him, I am furious. Call me when you get in, ok, bye.",31
MULDER,Dammit.,1
MULDER,"Dammit, ANSWER.",2
MULDER,SCULLY! You alright? He's not gonna get his quota this year.,11
MULDER,"Look at him, he's building another nest.",7
SCULLY,"You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic tests. The preliminary medical exam revealed quite abnormal development in the muscular and skeletal systems, as well as a continually declining metabolic rate. It dips way below the levels registered in deep sleep. Did you hear what I said Mulder?",50
MULDER,"All these people putting bars on their windows, spending good money on hi-tech security systems, trying to feel safe. I look at this guy and I think, ""It ain't enough"".",30
