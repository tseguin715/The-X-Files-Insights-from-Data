SHAINEH,"For God’s sake, Izzy!",4
BOOGER,"Here she comes. Let’s go. Come on, man.",8
SHAINEH,You got to be kidding.,5
IZZY,What?,1
SHAINEH,"Don’t ""what"" me, Izzy, or you ain’t going to no comic book convention.",13
IZZY,I’m 18. I go anywhere I want.,7
SHAINEH,"Yeah, but where you going to live when you get back?",11
IZZY,"Mom, we got to get going.",6
SHAINEH,"You drive careful, Booger. He’s the only son I’ve got.",10
BOOGER,"Okay, Mrs. B.",3
JERRY SPRINGER,I'm about to introduce you to a woman who three years ago was delivered the surprise of her life.,19
JERRY SPRINGER,"After nine months of what seemed like a normal pregnancy, doctors delivered to Dolores a very special child. Already a mother of two beautiful children, Dolores held in her arms a boy with fur like a dog and a hairline like Eddie Munster. She's here with us today with her real live, but sleeping, wolf baby.",56
JERRY SPRINGER,"Hey, why not just give him a razor and some shaving cream? I mean, he’s going to be shaving in a couple of years anyway.",25
WOLF BOY MOTHER,"Well, actually, he seems to be quite allergic to shaving cream. They seem to like him. They like to come up and touch his hair and tug on it a little.",31
JERRY SPRINGER,So they don't tease him?,5
WOLF BOY MOTHER,No. He's quite popular.,4
JERRY SPRINGER,Dandruff a problem?,3
WOLF BOY MOTHER,Mmm. No. I wash his hair twice a day and brush 100 strokes a night.,15
SHAINEH,I cain’t believe this.,4
JERRY SPRINGER,"I think the question the audience really wants answered is, uh... what does the father look like?",17
WOLF BOY MOTHER,The father is completely bald.,5
JERRY SPRINGER,Completely bald?,2
WOLF BOY MOTHER,Completely.,1
JERRY SPRINGER,Were you a hairy kid?,5
WOLF BOY MOTHER,No. I was not.,4
JERRY SPRINGER,Seriously?,1
WOLF BOY MOTHER,Really.,1
JERRY SPRINGER,Come on. Fess up. We have pictures here. We happen to know that you had hair all over your face.,20
WOLF BOY MOTHER,I'm afraid that that cannot be true.,7
JERRY SPRINGER,"I know this is a little delicate... but, uh, does he have any problem with fleas? I mean, he's not a real wolf boy, is he?",26
WOLF BOY MOTHER,No. I'm very careful about that. I buy the right products for fleas and... He does get the occasional itchies but he's all right.,24
JERRY SPRINGER,You don’t have fleas?,4
CHER,LONLINESS….,1
SHAINEH,Hello?! IS THE CLOAK YOU WEAR …,7
SHAINEH,Who’s there? DEEP SHADE OF BLUE IS ALWAYS THERE THE SUN AIN’T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE THE MOON AINT GONNA RISE IN THE SKY THE TEARS ARE ALWAYS CLOUDING YOUR EYES WHEN YOU’RE WITHOUT LOVE ….,35
SCULLY,"""Dear Special Agent Mulder: I’m writing to you for help. Several years ago I had an experience I could not explain. I was lying in my bed when I felt a presence in the room. Though I was awake. I felt that something had taken control over my body. I don’t remember much else but I woke up three days later pregnant with my son, Izzy. That was 18 years ago, but now it happened again. I was in bed and could swear I heard Cher singing … The one who was married to Sonny. Then the room got all smoky, and I saw some kind of monster. He had a really gross face with lumps all over his head. I was too scared to scream. Then I got all groggy and conked out for three days. Guess what happened when I woke up? I got your name off the TV. Some lady on the Jerry Springer show who had a werewolf baby said you came to her house. Well, I got her story beat by a mile so maybe you’ll want to come see me, too. Sincerely, Shaineh Berkowitz.""",190
MULDER,"Scully, do you think it’s too soon to get my own 1-900 number?",13
SHAINEH,"So, did you actually see that werewolf baby or was that just a story?",14
MULDER,No. It had something called hypertrechosis lanuginosa. It’s a rare hereditary condition most commonly found in some South American families.,20
SHAINEH,Uh huh. But it was all hairy and stuff?,9
SCULLY,"Uh, Mrs. Berkowitz? You said that you also had a son?",11
SHAINEH,Mm hmm. Izzy. That’s him there.,6
SCULLY,And Izzy is the product of your union with some kind of intruder?,13
SHAINEH,"I don’t know about no union, but I sure woke up in a condition.",14
SCULLY,Did you report this to the police?,7
SHAINEH,Of course I did.,4
SCULLY,Was there an investigation?,4
SHAINEH,"Not really. Nobody here ever locks their doors, and it took me a month of two to figure it out … I mean, that I was pregnant.",27
SCULLY,And now you’re pregnant again?,5
SHAINEH,"Uh huh, but as I told Agent Mulder on the phone, that’s what takes the cake.",16
MULDER,Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation two years ago.,9
SHAINEH,"You can’t plant a seed in a barren field. They were cooking something on the range. Took me two days of scrubbing to clean the skillet. I don’t know how many of them there were. I only saw the one, but they ate almost a whole damn jar of peanut butter.",51
SCULLY,"You were gone for three days, but nobody missed you?",10
SHAINEH,I know what you’re thinking.,5
SCULLY,"Do you drink, Mrs. Berkowitz?",5
SHAINEH,"No. But I’m not so sure my intruders, as you call them, didn’t have a few. Somebody set a tumbler here and didn’t use no coaster.",26
MULDER,Mmm.,1
SHAINEH,"That’s a family heirloom, too.",5
SCULLY,Is there no chance that your son could have put it there?,12
SHAINEH,"Izzy’s got more brains than that. Not much more, but he values his life. That pigsty there is his room.",20
SHAINEH,"You know what this thing is, don’t you Agent Mulder?",10
MULDER,Why do you say that?,5
SHAINEH,"'Cause you’re acting all quiet and stuff. And you know something you’re not saying -- about alien abductions. They said on the Jerry Springer show you’re, like, an expert.",28
MULDER,"Well, I don’t think this has anything to do with alien abductions. I don’t even know if I believe in that stuff anymore.",23
SHAINEH,"Oh, come on. Really?",4
SCULLY,Mrs. Berkowitz? You gave a description of the intruder. You said that he had a gross face and lumps on his head?,22
SHAINEH,And two mouths. I don’t know if I mentioned that.,10
SCULLY,Funny. Sounds just like this.,5
SHAINEH,"Oh, that? That’s the Great Mutato. That’s a comic book character my kid Izzy created.",15
IZZY,What’s going on?,3
SHAINEH,These are agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.,9
IZZY,The Federal Bureau of Investigation?,5
SCULLY,We were wondering how this suspect in your mother’s case looks exactly like this?,14
MULDER,The Great Mutato,3
IZZY,"Because I … I’ve seen him, too.",7
SCULLY,You’ve seen the Great Mutato?,5
IZZY,Yeah. A lot of people around here have.,8
SCULLY,Has it crossed neither of your minds that what you say you saw that night fits perfectly with this creature that your son created?,24
SHAINEH,"Well, yeah. But … that don’t mean it didn’t happen.",10
IZZY,"Don’t ask me why, but it works.",7
SCULLY,Peanut butter sandwiches?,3
MULDER,You think baloney would be more effective?,7
SCULLY,"Why are you humoring them, Mulder?",6
MULDER,"I’m not humoring them, Scully. This is a very serious crime.",11
SCULLY,So is perjury. So is calling out FBI agents under false pretenses.,12
MULDER,For the purpose of what?,5
SCULLY,Isn’t it obvious? I think that what we’re seeing here is an example of the culture for whom daytime talk shows and tabloid headlines have - have become a reality against which they measure their lives – a culture so obsessed with the media and a chance for self-dramatization that they’ll do anything in order to gain a spotlight.,58
MULDER,I am alarmed that you would reduce these people to a cultural stereotype. Not everybody’s dream is to get on Jerry Springer.,22
SCULLY,"Psychologists often speak of the denial of an unthinkable evil or a misplacement of shared fears. Anxieties taking the form of a hideous monster for whom the most horrific human attributes can be ascribed. What we can’t possibly imagine ourselves capable of we can blame on the ogre, on the hunchback, on the lowly half-breed.",55
NOTE,"Perfect opportunity for Cher's song, ""Half-Breed"", don'tcha think?!)",8
SCULLY,"But common sense alone will tell you that these legends, these unverified rumors are ridiculous.",15
MULDER,"But nonetheless, unverifiable, and therefore true in the sense that they’re believed to be true.",15
SCULLY,"Is there anything that you don’t believe in, Mulder?",9
MULDER,Shh.,1
SCULLY,What’s that sound?,3
IZZY,It’s the Great Mutato.,4
SCULLY,Where’d it go?,3
MULDER,I don’t know. I lost it.,6
MULDER,There. Up there.,3
OLD MAN,Turn that damn thing off. You’re on my property.,9
MULDER,We’re with the FBI.,4
OLD MAN,They’re not.,2
IZZY,We were --,2
SCULLY,We were just chasing what they told us was a monster.,11
OLD MAN,Monster? What’d I tell you boys? There ain’t no monster. I’ll show you the monster you’re looking for.,18
POLLIDORI,Who sent you here?,4
MULDER,Your father.,2
POLLIDORI,My father is a simpleton farmer. He understands nothing of my scientific achievements .,13
SCULLY,What achievements are those?,4
POLLIDORI,What makes you think you’d understand them any better?,9
SCULLY,"Well, I’m a scientist, for one.",6
POLLIDORI,"Well, then you probably know that once in a generation, perhaps once in a lifetime, a truth is uncovered which thrusts mankind into a shocking new consciousness turning accepted notions of our very existence on their head. Consider relativity, the double helix, and now the Homeotic Hox gene, for which I will undoubtedly have my place among the Columbuses of science as a visionary leader of men.",67
POLLIDORI,Yes?,1
GEEK LAB BOY,"What do you want me to do with these, Dr. Pollidori?",11
GEEK LAB BOY,Never mind.,2
MULDER,What is the Homeotic Hox gene?,6
POLLIDORI,She’s the scientist. Ask her.,5
SCULLY,"I, uh … I believe it has something to do with, um … growth and development.",16
POLLIDORI,"If you two will excuse me, I really don’t have time for this. I have to travel tonight to the University of Ingolstadt to deliver an international address.",28
SCULLY,"Sir, unless you want your scientific achievements to end up as a footnote on the Jerry Springer Show, I suggest that you make the time.",25
POLLIDORI,Jerry Springer Show?,3
POLLIDORI,"Witness the morphogenesis of Drosophila … the fruit fly. What you are watching has been going on for millennia since the Cambrian period some 580 million short years ago when Drosophila was first born. Notice the elegant symmetry with which the pupae grows into a series of beautiful segments. What we have found – what I have found – is that these segments represent a linear model for the genetic development of our friend, the fly. the legs, the mouth, the body, posterior and anterior. But which I, through my genius, can alter into a creation of my own. Behold … Proboscopedia.",102
MULDER,This fly has legs …,5
SCULLY,…. Growing out of his mouth.,6
MULDER,Why would you do that?,5
POLLIDORI,Because I can.,3
MULDER,Could that be done in humans?,6
POLLIDORI,That would go against every scientific convention.,7
MULDER,But could it be done?,5
POLLIDORI,Theoretically.,1
MULDER,"Good night, Dr. Frankenstein.",4
SCULLY,"Despite what you might think, Mulder, designer mutations like these are virtually impossible in humans.",15
MULDER,That’s not what I just heard.,6
SCULLY,"Mulder, even if they could, no scientist would even dare to perform this kind of experiment on a human.",19
MULDER,"Well, then why do them at all?",7
SCULLY,"To unlock the mysteries of genetics, to understand how it is that even though we share the same genes we develop arms instead of wings. We become humans instead of flies or monsters.",33
MULDER,"But, given the power, who could resist the temptation to create life in his own image?",16
SCULLY,"We already have that ability, Mulder. It’s called ""procreation."" And first thing tomorrow morning, I’m going to verify the pregnancy of Shaineh Berkowitz.",23
ELIZABETH,When are you coming home again?,6
POLLIDORI,Huh?,1
ELIZABETH,When are you coming home again?,6
POLLIDORI,What?,1
ELIZABETH,We were going to have that talk.,7
POLLIDORI,"Soon, soon. We’ll have our talk soon.",7
ELIZABETH,That’s what you always say.,5
POLLIDORI,"Elizabeth, you know how I feel about children. They’re mewling little monsters.",12
ELIZABETH,But I want children.,4
POLLIDORI,What happened to our dream about getting out of this place - getting away from this hick town?,17
ELIZABETH,I think that’s your dream.,5
POLLIDORI,"Listen, what do you want -- a baby or a Nobel Prize? See you on Thursday.",15

WAITRESS,"Hot plates! Hot, hot, hot. Biscuits, fritters, grits, flapjacks, eggs boiled, scrambled, poached, and fried. We got some monster grapefruits on the way. Bigger than your head, almost.",28
MULDER,"I -I’d just like some coffee, thanks.",7
WAITRESS,On the house. Compliments of J.J.,6
J.J.,That’s with two Js.,4
WAITRESS,Is it true that Jerry Springer’s coming to town?,9
SCULLY,We’ve been had. I’ll save you the trouble of reading the article. It has everything we talked about last night word for word.,23
SHAINEH,Izzy Berkowitz! Get your butt front and center!,8
IZZY,What did I do?,4
SHAINEH,All I can say is I hope the answer to that question is nothing.,14
SCULLY,We have reason to believe that you or one of your friends recorded our conversation last night and gave it to a newspaper reporter.,24
IZZY,Me?,1
SCULLY,In order to promote you comic book monster that you created.,11
MULDER,"Do you own a tape recorder, Izzy?",7
IZZY,Um …,2
SHAINEH,Christmas nineteen ninety THREE!!,4
SCULLY,… in the form of a hideous monster given the most horrific human attributes …,15
SHAINEH,That’s for starters!,3
SCULLY,… What we can’t possibly imagine…,6
SHAINEH,Hey! Hey that’s it. That’s the song that was playing when I got knocked up.,15
SCULLY,Who the hell is that?,5
MULDER,That’s the same voice we heard out in the woods last night.,12
IZZY,That’s him. The Great Mutato.,5
CHER AND GREAT MUTATO,THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE THE MOON AIN'T GONNA RISE IN THE SKY TEARS ARE ALWAYS CLOUDING YOUR EYES THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE WHEN YOU'RE WITHOUT... LOVE...,30
SCULLY,Where are we going now?,5
MULDER,To messenger this to the Bureau. I want special audio to filter the tracks and then I want to go back to see the professor.,25
SCULLY,"Mulder, this is just a dopey hoax.",7
MULDER,"Something recorded its voice on this, Scully.",7
SCULLY,And you think that Dr. Pollidori has something to do with it?,12
MULDER,"When Victor Frankenstein asks himself ""Whence did the principle of life proceed?"" and then as a gratifying summit to his toils creates a hideous phantasm of a man he prefigures the Postmodern Prometheus. The genetic engineer whose power to reanimate matter – genes into life – us – is only as limited as his imagination is.",56
SCULLY,"Mulder, I’m alarmed that you would reduce this man to a literary stereotype, a mad scientist.",16
MULDER,Who else would go to such trouble to impregnate Shaineh Berkowitz?,11
SCULLY,"I have to admit, Mulder. Everything looks in order. Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation in 1993 and two months ago she had two pregnancy tests both with positive results.",30
SCULLY,What are you doing?,4
MULDER,"Mrs. Berkowitz said in her letter that when she saw her intruder there was a gaseous white cloud and then when she woke up three days later, nobody knew that she’d been gone.",33
SCULLY,Yeah. So?,2
CHER,"I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELIN' SHOW MY MAMA USED TO DANCE FOR THE MONEY THEY'D THROW PAPA WOULD DO WHATEVER HE COULD PREACH A LITTLE GOSPEL SELL A COUPLE BOTTLES OF DOCTOR GOOD GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES WE'D HEAR IT FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN THEY CALLED US GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES BUT EVERY NIGHT, ALL THE MEN WOULD COME AROUND AND LAY THEIR MONEY DOWN...",71
SCULLY,Come on … Get up! Move!,6
SCULLY,Mulder?,1
OLD MAN,I told you there ain’t no monster.,7
POLLIDORI,What are you doing in my house?,7
ELIZABETH,"He had this awful face with these hideous tumors, and … and not one mouth, but two.",17
POLLIDORI,"Oh, my God.",3
MULDER,Dr. Pollidori. Is there something you’d like to tell us?,10
POLLIDORI,Are you accusing me of knowing something that I’m not telling you?,12
MULDER,I’m accusing that your wife may have been impregnated.,9
POLLIDORI,Impregnated? By whom?,3
MULDER,"Oh, I think you know.",5
SCULLY,"Sir, with all due respect I think that this is all part of a hoax.",15
POLLIDORI,A hoax?,2
SCULLY,A shameless publicity stunt.,4
MULDER,Scully?,1
POLLIDORI,What … what is that?,5
MULDER,"The other victims, they had their frying pans … violated. Do you know what that is?",16
POLLIDORI,"No, I don’t.",3
MULDER,I think we found our smoking gun.,7
MASK BOY,"Hey, Mom. You look great.",5
CHER,You look great.,3
MASK BOY,"Mom, I have some great news.",6
CHER,"Me, too.",2
MASK BOY,You first.,2
CHER,I quit. I’m clean as a whistle.,7
MASK BOY,"All right, Ma …",4
OLD MAN,"I brought you your favorite. You finish your movie but don’t stay up too late, okay, son?",17
MASK BOY,"Well, that’s a start.",4
CHER,"Well, what about your news?",5
MASK BOY,"Oh, it’s no big deal. I met a girl. We’re going out.",12
CHER,Come on. Tell us.,4
MASK BOY,"Well, her name is Diana ….",6
CHER,Yeah?,1
MASK BOY,And she’s beautiful. She’s got long blond hair. She rides horses and she’s beautiful and she’s smart and she loves me.,21
CHER,"What’s not to love, baby?",5
POLLIDORI,Tell me it isn’t true. You didn’t. You wouldn’t. Why?,10
OLD MAN,Because I can.,3
LARGE MAN,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,Not a problem.,3
MULDER,What’s this?,2
WAITRESS,Compliments of J.J. Coffee?,4
MULDER,Sure.,1
MULDER,"Whoa! That’s not a place you want to burn a guy. ""FBI Agents Say Monster A ‘Hoax’."")",17
POSTAL MAN,You want to see your monster?,6
CROWD,Yeah!,1
POSTAL MAN,You really want to see your monster?,7
CROWD,Yeah!,1
POSTAL MAN,Here’s your monster.,3
POSTAL MAN,His name is Izzy Berkowitz!,5
CROWD,No! String him up!,4
SHAINEH,Get your filthy hands off him! You let him go!,10
POSTAL MAN,I intercepted a package.,4
SHAINEH,"How would you like your face to intercept my fist, coconut head?",12
CROWD MAN,Your kid’s a monster!,4
CROWD,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,4
SHAINEH,That is my son you’re talking about!,7
SCULLY,Mulder …. You may have been right. That these people can be reduced to cultural stereotypes?,16
MULDER,They unmasked the monster.,4
SCULLY,I may have found something that says otherwise. The residue in the frying pan was an agricultural product used to anesthetize herds of animals.,24
MULDER,Used by who?,3
SCULLY,Farmers … who have to register with the FDA even to have it in their possession.,16
MULDER,Is there someone registered locally?,5
SCULLY,Mm - hmm.,2
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,We may be too late. I think we are. Who’s that? Show yourself!,13
SCULLY,"If you’re armed, drop your weapon and walk out slowly!",10
CHICKENLIKE WOMAN,Please don’t … don’t kill me.,6
MULDER,Who are you?,3
CHICKENLIKE WOMAN,I’m with the newspaper.,4
MULDER,What’s your business here?,4
CHICKENLIKE WOMAN,The old man was murdered.,5
SCULLY,By whom?,2
MULDER,It’s alive.,2
CHICKENLIKE WOMAN,"I’ve seen it … in the barn, burying the old man",11
MULDER,"Whatever you have in mind, I’m going to have to ask you to stop right there.",16
POLLIDORI,We have come for the murderer.,6
CROWD,Yeah!,1
SCULLY,What makes you think he’s here?,6
POLLIDORI,I’ve seen him with my own eyes. He is not a man. He is a monster!,16
CROWD,Yeah!,1
POLLIDORI,"The fiend must be found, and then we’ll let justice take its course!",13
CROWD,Yeah!,1
POLLIDORI,"We’ll search every crevice, every ravine. You get him alive if you can, but you get him!",17
CROWD,Yeah! Kill him!,3
SCULLY,There’s only one way Pollidori could have seen that monster … If he was out here himself.,17
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
SCULLY,"Federal agents, and we’re armed! Come on out!",8
MULDER,"Hey, Scully. Look at this.",5
SCULLY,Oh...,1
SCULLY,"Oh, my God.",3
MULDER,You’re going to have to come out of there.,9
SCULLY,We’re not going to hurt you. Do you think he understands?,11
MULDER,I hope not.,3
SCULLY,He looks frightened.,3
MULDER,"We’re going to have to get him out of here, Scully. They’re going to kill him.",16
CROWD MAN,The barn’s on fire!,4
CROWD,Fire! Fire!,2
CHICKENLIKE REPORTER WOMAN,There it is!,3
POLLIDORI,Let him go.,3
SHAINEH,Where is he?,3
POLLIDORI,You let him go or we’ll burn him out.,9
SHAINEH,"Where is he? Show the world your horrid, lumpy face!",10
CROWD,Yeah!,1
ELIZABETH,That’s him.,2
SHAINEH,Ugh.,1
POLLIDORI,That repulsive physiognomy is the vilest perversion of science.,9
MULDER,Created by whom?,3
POLLIDORI,A pale student of my most hallowed arts whose life was taken by that which he gave life. By his own horrible creation. By that monstrosity that you see before you.,31
SHAINEH,Who’s he taking about?,4
POLLIDORI,My father.,2
GREAT MUTATO,No.,1
SHAINEH,He can talk.,3
POLLIDORI,Your ears deceive you. It’s a trick.,7
GREAT MUTATO,"I’m sorry. My voice is damaged by the gaseous chemicals, but I would like to explain myself. Despite my appearance which you see is quite horrible to the human senses, I … have never acted to harm another soul.",39
POLLIDORI,These are fiendish lies!,4
MULDER,Quiet.,1
GREAT MUTATO,"25 years ago, my father, having only one son, a spiteful, hateful man of science incapable of the deeper sentiments. He came to realize that this son had been conducting secret experiments of which I was the most unfortunate product.",40
GREAT MUTATO,"A simple man, he rescued me and loved me in spite of my deformities. But, as time passed, I grew restless for friends of my own. Because I couldn’t go to school or play sports or… or even show my face outside this farm, my father set out to learn his son’s science so that before he died, he might create for me a mate.",65
SHAINEH,Uh oh.,2
GREAT MUTATO,"Alas, my father was a simple man. His heart close to the soil he worked, the animals he tended….",19
GREAT MUTATO,The experiments he attempted too advanced for his understanding. The results of his experiments – unsatisfactory.,16
SHAINEH,"I still … you mean, Izzy … but who’s the father?",11
GREAT MUTATO,"Suffice to say his experiments failed and … my father is dead. I am alone … and miserable but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. If this being you can create, then I will take blame as a murderer.",46
POLLIDORI,I don’t know how to re-create you. You were a mistake.,11
GREAT MUTATO,"What we did was wrong, but in our trespasses we gave you a loving son and in your homes I went places I’d never dreamed of. With your books, and your records and home media centers, I learned of the world and of a mother’s love that I’ll never know. Cher loved that boy so much.",56
IZZY,Hey … he’s no monster.,5
GREAT MUTATO,"Arrest me then, as you will.",6
SCULLY,"We should go, Mulder. The prisoner’s in the car.",9
MULDER,"This is all wrong, Scully. This is not how the story is supposed to end.",15
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,"Dr. Frankenstein pays for his evil ambitions, yes. But the monster’s supposed to escape to go search for his bride.",20
SCULLY,"There’s not going to be any bride, Mulder. Not in this story.",12
MULDER,"Well, where’s the writer? I want to speak to the writer.",11
