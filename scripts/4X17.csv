STEWARDESS,"Here you are, Mister Rebhun, another scotch and soda.",9
LAROLD REBHUN,"It's the only way to fly. Used to be just like you. Used to hate flying. I mean, the moment I got on the plane, I'd be gripping those armrests like my teeth were being drilled. Truth is, statistically, you can fly every day for the next twenty-six thousand years before you'd have an accident. You believe that? Whoa, baby. Settle down now.",63
PILOT,What the hell is this?,5
WAITERS,Happy birthday to you... happy birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Dana...,12
MULDER,Special Agent Dana Katherine Scully...,5
WAITERS,Happy birthday to you!,4
MULDER,"I didn't know it was your birthday, Scully.",8
SCULLY,Mulder... you have never remembered my birthday in the four years I've known you.,14
MULDER,"That's the way I like to celebrate them... It's every four years, it's like dog years that way.",18
SCULLY,Dog years? Thank you.,4
MULDER,"You're welcome. Oh, I got something for you.",8
SCULLY,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",7
MULDER,It's just something that reminded me of you.,8
SCULLY,"What, an alien implant?",4
MULDER,"Two, actually. I made them into earrings.",7
SCULLY,Hmmm... Apollo eleven.,3
MULDER,Read the back.,3
SCULLY,"""Commemorating Apollo Eleven and the mission to the moon, July 1969.""",11
MULDER,"It's, um...",2
SHARON GRAFFIA,"Excuse me, are you Scully? And Mulder?",7
SCULLY,"Oh, promise me this isn't leading to something really embarrassing.",10
SHARON GRAFFIA,"My name is Sharon Graffia. I'm sorry to approach you like this, but I followed you. I was asked to find you if something happened.",25
SCULLY,Excuse me?,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,"You have no good reason to believe me, but my brother, who I believe you know, he said you'd understand what to do.",23
MULDER,About what?,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,If he didn't make it.,5
SCULLY,"Excuse me, who are you talking about?",7
SHARON GRAFFIA,"Max. Max Fenig. He was on his way here to deliver something that made him fear for his life, something he said the government would kill for... but his plane, it went down two hours ago.",36
"NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 4",02 A.M.,2
MIKE MILLAR,"What we know right now is that the plane designated as Flight five-four-nine lost radio contact tonight at nineteen-hundred hours E.D.T. and subsequently crashed into a wooded area approximately thirty miles from Albany, New York. Local law enforcement and E.M.T.s have been on the scene for just under two hours, but initial reports are they've found no survivors yet of the one-hundred and thirty-four passengers and crew listed on the manifest. I wish we could tell you more information about the crash site, but, uh, darkness and terrain are going to make it pretty slow going in the morning. We have a tape of the last radio exchange before five-four-nine went down, which we're going to play, but I want to stress the need to keep everything you know or learn within the Go-team so that all the information to the press comes from the I.I.C. You keyed-up, John?",149
JOHN,Ready.,1
PILOT,"Copy, Tower, please advise. Do you see a need to adjust?",11
TOWER,"Negative, five-four-nine. Steady airspeed of two-niner-six knots. Maintain heading one-zero-zero and two-niner thousand feet. Go ahead, five-four-nine.",17
PILOT,What the hell is this?,5
TOWER,"Five-four-nine, do you read?",4
PILOT,"We've got something... on intercept. Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!",13
MIKE MILLAR,"And that's all she wrote. The controllers tried to raise five-four-nine on all available frequencies, but the pilots did not respond. Okay, we've got an F.A.A. charter leaving in one hour. Accommodations...",32
MULDER,"Excuse me, sir. I'm Special Agent Mulder with the F.B.I. Is there any indication or suspicion that Flight five-forty-nine may have been forced down?",24
MIKE MILLAR,Forced down?,2
MULDER,"Uh, you can clearly here the pilot say ""intercept"" on the recording.",12
MIKE MILLAR,"We have absolutely no data to support that, no confirmation of other aircraft in the area. Unless you have something.",20
MULDER,"No, no, but there was a passenger on that plane who was, uh, well-known to our government as an alien abductee.",21
MIKE MILLAR,An alien abductee.,3
MULDER,"Yeah, a man named Max Fenig, a multiple abduction victim, what's known as a repeater.",15
MIKE MILLAR,"Hold on a second. Please, please, can I have some quiet?",11
MULDER,"He'd predicted the accident, and from the sound of the tape, the plane may have been forced down.",18
MIKE MILLAR,Forced down by who? Or what?,6
MULDER,I'm hesitant to speculate.,4
MIKE MILLAR,"Mulder, your name's Mulder?",4
MULDER,"Yes, sir.",2
MIKE MILLAR,Let me tell you something. I've been doing this for eighteen years. I thought I heard everything.,17
MAN,"I'm looking through the manifest here, and there was no one named Max Fen-ig on Flight five-four-nine.",17
MULDER,"Fenig, and there may be people who want to cover up this evidence.",13
MIKE MILLAR,"Agent Mulder, is this an official F.B.I. position?",8
MULDER,"No, sir.",2
MIKE MILLAR,Because what you're suggesting trivializes this tragedy... and casts these fine people and the work they have to do in a light that I think you would be well-advised to avoid.,31
MULDER,"I think we all share the same goal here, sir, and that's to find out what caused that plane to crash.",21
MIKE MILLAR,"And if any of the capable men and women find... Doctor Spock's phaser or some green alien goo, we'll be sure to give you all the credit. All right, then...",30
SCULLY,You sure know how to make a girl feel special on her birthday.,13
FLIGHT 549 CRASH SITE; 5,52 A.M.,2
SCULLY,You ever seen anything like this?,6
MULDER,Where's the plane?,3
SCULLY,They think it hit the ground at over three-hundred miles an hour on an almost vertical descent. Meteorological data is being collected and analyzed and so far they are attributing the cause to... a weather phenomenon... To a rapid depressurization caused by a lightning strike or by something called a wind rotor coming off the Adirondacks.,56
MULDER,But not to Max Fenig.,5
SCULLY,"Mulder, even if he was on this flight, looking at this, he'd be in a hundred pieces. I mean, they're going to be lucky if they can I.D. half the bodies they find here.",34
MULDER,"No, he was on this flight, Scully, I'm sure of that.",11
SCULLY,"Well, say we do find him. What's that going to prove?",11
MULDER,I don't know... but maybe that one man's life was worth sacrificing a hundred-and-thirty-three others.,15
MULDER,Is that a hand? Is that a watch?,8
SCULLY,Yeah.,1
MULDER,What does it read?,4
SCULLY,Eight-oh-one.,1
MULDER,So does this one. What are they listing as the time of the crash?,14
SCULLY,"Uh, seven-fifty-two P.M.",3
MULDER,That's nine minutes difference.,4
SCULLY,It must be a mistake.,5
MULDER,"Nine minutes, Scully. Do you remember the last time you were missing nine minutes?",14
SCULLY,"Mulder, no one even reported the plane on radar. These guys are just going off of estimates until they can recover the data recorder.",24
MULDER,"Yeah, something just occurred to me.",6
SCULLY,What?,1
MULDER,I don't think we're going to find Max Fenig after all.,11
SCULLY,"Just a few minutes ago, you were absolutely certain he was on this flight.",14
MULDER,"Yeah, but I'm beginning to doubt whether he finished this flight with the rest of the passengers.",17
MAN #1,Hey! Get me a medic over here! This man's alive! This man's alive! Get me a medic over here! Somebody!,20
MAN #2,Right here!,2
MAN #3,"Let's go, let's go!",4
SCULLY,We need an airlift to a burn unit as soon as possible! This man needs oxygen and a saline I.V.! Sir? Can you hear me? Sir?,26
FULTON COUNTY AIRPORT; 7,12 P.M.,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,I got what you asked for.,6
SCULLY,All of those are from Max?,6
SHARON GRAFFIA,"Every letter he ever wrote me. You said to bring everything I had, I'm still not sure why.",18
SCULLY,"Sharon, we believe that there are things that you haven't told us. We need to know everything that you know.",20
SHARON GRAFFIA,About what?,2
SCULLY,"About Max. About where he's been, about where he's traveled, about exactly what it was he was carrying on that flight.",21
SHARON GRAFFIA,Did you find Max?,4
SCULLY,"No, but we found a passenger with severe burns, severe cellular damage. Burns that we wouldn't see unless the victim was exposed to a high level of radiation.",28
SHARON GRAFFIA,Something Max was carrying?,4
SCULLY,"We need to know what that was, Sharon. If you're withholding any information, there could be severe consequences.",18
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"This man's name was Larold Rebhun. The manifest has him listed in seat thirteen-D, which is the aisle seat right here. My guess is that Max Fenig was in thirteen-F, window seat. But the manifest has the passenger listed as a...",41
SCULLY,"Paul Gidney. It's an alias that Max Fenig used in his letters when he went underground. He had many aliases, in fact, one of which he used to get a job at the Rocky Flats Environment Energy Site in Colorado where they handle and store Uranium two-three-five and weapons grade plutonium.",51
MULDER,You think Max was carrying plutonium?,6
SCULLY,"Mulder, the burns on that passenger's face were deep tissue radiation burns. I don't know how else he might have gotten them.",22
MULDER,What would Max be doing with that?,7
SCULLY,"I don't know. I mean, he, he wrote hundreds, maybe even a thousand letters describing his abduction experiences, but beginning in January, he started making vague references to a theft. Now, it seems to me from reading it that he'd started to get the idea that he'd come onto something that was very dangerous.",54
MULDER,So... what caused this crash?,5
SCULLY,"If he was carrying fissile plutonium, Mulder, and it became exposed in the cabin, it very conceivably could have caused the crash.",22
MULDER,"You want to know what I think, Scully? I'm going to tell you. I think Max was abducted. Sucked right out of this door at twenty-nine thousand feet. The burns we're seeing are a result of that abduction.",38
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"And all the evidence will point to this conclusion but it will be dismissed because of it's improbability, it's unthinkability.",20
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,"The crash of Flight five-forty-nine will go unsolved unless we find a way to prove it. And when Max is returned, he's going to tell us exactly the same story unless someone gets to him first.",36
SCULLY,"Mulder, Max is returned. I found out a few minutes ago. They found his body a short way from the wreckage earlier today.",23
MULDER,You're positive of this?,4
SCULLY,"Traveling under the name of Paul Gidney, seat thirteen-F, with the same burns as his seat mate.",17
MULDER,There's still no explanation for this crash.,7
"PARADISE MOTEL; NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 10",16 P.M.,2
MIKE MILLAR,Would you guys be willing to make a determination as to whether there was an explosion pre-impact or... as we can see from the fuel tank parts we've recovered from here......whether the data only points to an explosion after the aircraft...,41
SCULLY,"Did you make a positive I.D. on Max Fenig? Well, they've located the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.",21
MULDER,And?,1
SCULLY,"And the I.I.C. is making a statement to the press, saying that there was a complete systems malfunction on the plane.",21
MULDER,"In other words, there's still no explanation for what brought this plane down.",13
SCULLY,"No, not yet, but they are taking a careful look at the emergency exit door, and while they cannot explain the radiation readings, they are not ready to attribute it as the direct cause.",34
MULDER,"They're not able to, or they're not willing to?",9
SCULLY,"Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?",8
MULDER,"Because there are no facts, Scully. What they're telling you, what they're going to report, they're the opposite of the facts. A claim to ignorance of the facts. Claimed steadfastly, ignorance becomes as acceptable as the truth.",37
SCULLY,What would you like them to report?,7
MULDER,That there is not one wristwatch on any of those bagged bodies. All of the wristwatches have been stolen.,19
SCULLY,Are you accusing these men of covering evidence?,8
MULDER,"These men, no. These men are trained to identify moving parts. Hydraulics, electronics. They're trained to reconstruct those parts and the past and arrive at the present. But they can't do that because somebody has stolen the past from them. Nine minutes of it. Nine minutes that became a lifetime for those passengers, and now for their families. Someone has got to figure out what happened in those nine minutes. Somehow, we've got to get them back.",77
VON DREHLE AIR FORCE; RESERVE INSTALLATION; 9,37 A.M.,2
MULDER,Louis Frish?,2
LOUIS FRISH,"Yes, sir. I just got the call from the C.O., said you were coming out with some questions.",18
MULDER,I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.,7
LOUIS FRISH,"If you're here about the crash the other night, I already told the N.T.S.B. guys exactly what I know about that.",21
SCULLY,They were already out here?,5
LOUIS FRISH,"Yes, ma'am. Night of the crash.",6
MULDER,Were you in the tower that night?,7
LOUIS FRISH,"Yes, sir. Me and Sergeant Armando Gonzales.",7
MULDER,Did Flight five-forty-nine show up on your radar?,8
LOUIS FRISH,"Yes, sir, it did.",4
MULDER,Did you establish radio contact with them?,7
LOUIS FRISH,"No, sir. We would have no reason to contact a commercial or a civilian airliner unless it crossed into military airspace.",21
MULDER,Would there be a record of five-forty-nine on your log?,10
LOUIS FRISH,"Yes, sir. I know it by heart. At nineteen-fifty-two, Flight five-four-nine dropped from an altitude of twenty-nine thousand feet. About forty-five seconds later, we got an altitude reading of triple-x. I've never seen anything like it. Hope to never again.",40
SCULLY,Then what did you do?,5
LOUIS FRISH,"We called five-four-nine, got no response. Then we called A.T.C. in Albany.",12
MULDER,What was their response?,4
LOUIS FRISH,We just gave them the information. Last we'd heard. Is there something else you're looking for?,16
MULDER,About nine minutes.,3
SCULLY,We've been traveling a long way.,6
MULDER,Wasn't the initial report that there was no radar confirmation of the crash?,13
SCULLY,"Yeah, that must have come after our briefing.",8
ARMANDO GONZALES,What did you tell them?,5
LOUIS FRISH,What I was supposed to say.,6
ARMANDO GONZALES,Somebody's going to figure out what's going on.,8
LOUIS FRISH,I don't ask. I don't know. I don't want to know.,11
ARMANDO GONZALES,"They find out the truth, you think anybody's going to take the heat for us?",15
LOUIS FRISH,I'm not the only liar here.,6
ARMANDO GONZALES,"They come back here to talk to me, I'm telling the truth. I'm not going to have no blood on me.",21
LOUIS FRISH,Then you make me the liar.,6
"NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 2",32 P.M.,2
POLICE OFFICER,Right.,1
MOTEL MANAGER,We don't want any trouble. Did they find her?,9
POLICE OFFICER,"No, ma'am.",2
MOTEL MANAGER,"Well, we need some answers. The place is a mess.",10
POLICE OFFICER,You'll have to take care of this.,7
MOTEL MANAGER,"Hey, you're going to have to take care of this. You're going to have to pay.",16
SCULLY,Excuse me?,2
MOTEL MANAGER,"The room you rented for the woman? Well, she trashed it and split.",13
MULDER,Sharon Graffia?,2
MOTEL MANAGER,It was under your name.,5
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MOTEL MANAGER,Look at this. I don't know what kind of game she was playing in here. She blew the door right out of the jamb. I doubt insurance will cover it.,30
MULDER,Does your policy cover the acts of extraterrestrials?,8
SCULLY,We'll take care of it.,5
MOTEL MANAGER,Right.,1
MULDER,"Okay, Scully, hit me with your best shot. What do you think happened here?",14
SCULLY,I haven't a clue.,4
MULDER,It looks an awful lot to me like this place fell from twenty-nine thousand feet.,15
SCULLY,You think Max's sister was...,5
MULDER,"Was abducted, just like Max. Maybe it runs in the family.",11
MIKE MILLAR,What happened here?,3
MULDER,You're the experts. Why don't you bring your team down here and work it out?,15
MIKE MILLAR,They've got their hands full.,5
MULDER,"Yeah, coming up with all that inconclusive evidence.",8
MIKE MILLAR,I've come to tell you we've found some evidence. Good evidence.,11
SCULLY,About what caused the crash?,5
MIKE MILLAR,"Quite possibly, though I'm not ready to make an announcement.",10
MULDER,Why not?,2
MIKE MILLAR,I'm afraid I'd sound as crazy as you. Is there someplace I can show you these? Someplace with a door?,20
MIKE MILLAR,"These lines you see here, running outward from center, these are what we call fatigue cracks, caused by cyclic stress on the fuselage structure.",24
SCULLY,From what?,2
MIKE MILLAR,"Wear and tear. Most commercial planes have an average twenty, thirty thousand hours' flight time. Except five-forty-nine was a new plane. Five-forty-nine had no wear and tear.",27
MULDER,Then what caused that?,4
MIKE MILLAR,"I can't tell you that. But I can tell you this... The way all these cracks radiate from a central point, it looks like the door was shaken and blown outward straight off it's frame. Right off the plane. If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have known what to look for.",53
SCULLY,Sounds like what you're describing is physically impossible.,8
MIKE MILLAR,"In normal operation, it could never happen. Not this way.",10
MULDER,But it did.,3
LOUIS FRISH,"Hey, man. How you doing? I'm sorry about before. It's a... I was way out of line. I just... I've just been letting this thing get to me, I guess. Hey, Gonzales.",32
SCOTT GARRETT,Did you find him?,4
MAN,Not up there.,3
<-7,04 P.M.->,2
TOWER,Thirty-five thousand feet. It's negligible. Nothing to be concerned about.,10
PILOT,"Copy, Tower, please advise. Do you see a need to adjust?",11
TOWER,"Negative, five-four-nine. Steady airspeed of two-niner-six knots. Maintain heading one-zero-zero and two-niner thousand feet. Go ahead, five-four-nine.",17
PILOT,What the hell is this?,5
TOWER,"Five-four-nine, do you read?",4
PILOT,"We've got something... on intercept. Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!",13
SCULLY,Scully.,1
MULDER,"Hey, Scully, it's me. I, I just realized something. The, the voice of the air-traffic controller, I've heard it before.",20
SCULLY,"Mulder, we've been up for over thirty-six hours, can't it wait...",11
MULDER,"No, I know, I know, I know, I know, I just need you to come over and listen to this right now, okay?",23
SCULLY,I'm on my way.,4
LOUIS FRISH,Just don't scream. Just listen to me. Listen to me. I'm the man responsible. I'm the one who caused that plane crash.,22
MIKE MILLAR,"Uh, give me a second. You said you had someone who had some information.",14
SCULLY,"This is Louis Frish, Sergeant Frish. He's the air-traffic controller you heard on the recording that you played for us the other night.",23
MIKE MILLAR,That was from the Albany Control Center. It was the voice of a civilian air-traffic controller.,16
LOUIS FRISH,"No, sir.",2
MULDER,"There seems to be more than a little discrepancy. What you've been told, what you've been led to believe, was built upon a lie that Sergeant Frish was asked to perpetuate, along with Sergeant Gonzales, who is now dead.",39
LOUIS FRISH,I was asked to lie. I was ordered to lie about what happened to Flight five-four-nine.,16
MIKE MILLAR,By whom?,2
LOUIS FRISH,"My C.O. Flight five-four-nine appeared on my radar at nineteen-hundred hours, when we were asked to give it's coordinates at fifteen-second intervals. About two minutes past thirty degrees north, we saw a second aircraft enter five-four-nine's airspace in an intercept pattern. It shadowed five-four-nine for another ten minutes before we were asked to give a new set of coordinates. A few seconds later, there was an explosion... and five-four-nine disappeared from my radar screen.",74
MIKE MILLAR,"I don't believe this man. There's not one speck of forensic detail to support it. No sign of an explosion, no flashing, no residues, no nitrated or oxidation, nothing.",29
LOUIS FRISH,"I'm telling you what I saw. That we shot down a civilian jet, knowingly and willingly.",16
MIKE MILLAR,I'm going to tell you two something. I have a responsibility to the truth here.,15
MULDER,And so do we.,4
MIKE MILLAR,"This man can't testify to this story, not without evidence.",10
MULDER,The military is working to cover up that evidence.,9
MIKE MILLAR,The sergeant's story makes no sense.,6
MULDER,"Unless the aircraft that was fired on never appeared on his radar screen. A third, unidentified aircraft that engaged the civilian jet which the sergeant never saw.",27
MIKE MILLAR,A stealth aircraft?,3
MULDER,"Shot down by the intercept aircraft, which, in turn, may have caused the crash of Flight five-forty-nine, which means that the cause of this crash is not here in this hangar, but is out there somewhere at a second crash site.",41
SCULLY,Somebody would have spotted it.,5
MULDER,"No, they didn't know to look for that. They didn't know about a second aircraft, except the military. Which means that this man's life is in danger because he can put the pieces together.",34
SCULLY,Then somebody has to get him someplace safe.,8
MIKE MILLAR,If there's a second crash site... let's find it.,9
SCULLY,Mulder.,1
MULDER,Hold on.,2
SCULLY,Mulder...,1
MULDER,"Louis, help me out.",4
LOUIS FRISH,Don't take your foot off the gas.,7
MULDER,Is he going to see us?,6
LOUIS FRISH,No. We've got to get under him.,7
MULDER,We're not going to make it.,6
FLIGHT 549 CRASH SITE; 10,14 P.M.,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,Somebody help me! Please!,4
MIKE MILLAR,Who's there?,2
SHARON GRAFFIA,"Oh, don't... don't let them take me again...",8
FULTON COUNTY AIRPORT; 11,17 P.M.,2
MULDER,"Scully! Louis! I want to ask you something. This is where Flight five-forty-nine went down. As far as you know, there's been no substantiation of a second crash site?",29
LOUIS FRISH,Right.,1
MULDER,"What if that's because there is no second crash site, because that second aircraft never fell to the ground? It came down somewhere around here.",25
SCULLY,In Great Sacandaga Lake?,4
MULDER,Yeah.,1
LOUIS FRISH,"Traveling north to south at fifteen degrees... it's a shallower descent. Yeah, that's very possible.",15
MULDER,Possible? Are you okay taking Sergeant Frish back to D.C.?,10
SCULLY,By myself?,2
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,"You just let me know what's going on, Mulder.",9
MULDER,As soon as I know. I saw the sign. Are you Bearfeld?,12
BRUCE BEARFELD,Yeah.,1
MULDER,I stopped by your place. Nobody was home.,8
BRUCE BEARFELD,Who are you?,3
MULDER,Fox Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.,6
BRUCE BEARFELD,You got anything to do with what's going on out there?,11
MULDER,What's going on out there?,5
BRUCE BEARFELD,"Some kind of search-and-rescue operation or some damn thing, I don't know.",12
MULDER,Where?,1
BRUCE BEARFELD,"Out over Democrat Point. Some kind of hovering lights, there and then go.",13
MULDER,"Can you show me? No, no, no. I need you to take me.",13
SCULLY,I'm just going to get some things.,7
LOUIS FRISH,What then?,2
SCULLY,"I'm going to ask for some kind of protective arrangement. I need to talk to my agent in charge to get a feel for how to go on this, but, uh, I think it's pretty clear you're going to want to talk to the right people.",46
LOUIS FRISH,You think I'll be prosecuted?,5
SCULLY,For what?,2
LOUIS FRISH,I gave the coordinates.,4
SCULLY,"You didn't bring that plane down, Louis.",7
LOUIS FRISH,"I lied. I misled a federal investigator, I misled you. A hundred and thirty-four people, Sergeant Gonzales, they're all dead.",20
SCULLY,It wasn't your fault.,4
LOUIS FRISH,"But I'll have to live with it. I watched that plane fall out of the sky. It was just a dot on the screen, just a... set of numbers. The wreckage... I can't get that out of my mind. How those people died... how easy it is to lie, just to say it was a dot on the screen... until you see it.",63
SCULLY,"Look, I can't tell you how to feel, Louis, but I can tell you that I will do everything I can to make sure you tell your story to somebody who will do the right thing.",36
LOUIS FRISH,"Yeah. Thank you. You think it's safe to make a phone call? I'd, I'd like to tell my girlfriend that I'm... whatever.",22
SCULLY,"Yeah, um... just tell her you're okay.",7
GREAT SCANDAGA LAKE; 1,02 AM,2
MULDER,Over there. How deep is it here?,7
BRUCE BEARFELD,"Fifty, sixty maybe. Have you worked at this depth before?",10
MULDER,Not exactly.,2
BRUCE BEARFELD,What exactly is your experience?,5
MULDER,"Once, I, uh... I got a quarter off of the deep end at the ""Y"" pool.",16
BARTENDER,"Last call, folks! Cocktail?",4
SCULLY,We're going to be met here by a federal marshall. You're probably going to end up sleeping in somebody's office. You want a drink? You need a drink.,28
PENDRELL,Hey! Birthday girl!,3
SCULLY,"Agent Pendrell, how are you doing?",6
PENDRELL,"I, I have something for you. Where have you been?",10
SCULLY,"I've been, uh, gone.",4
PENDRELL,Oh. Can I buy you a drink?,7
SCULLY,"No, you know what? That's okay, I'm with somebody.",9
PENDRELL,Oh. Let me buy him a drink too.,8
SCULLY,"No, you know what? It's okay.",6
PENDRELL,"No, no, no, I insist, I insist. Bartender, bartender!",9
BARTENDER,Yeah.,1
PENDRELL,"Set me up with, uh, a couple of, uh, birthday girl drinks here. Can I have a couple of your finest beers, skip the glasses, and another one of these...",30
SCULLY,"Get down! You're going to keep breathing, Pendrell. Do you hear me?",12
