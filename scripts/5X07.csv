SCULLY'S VOICE OVER,"It begins where it ends... In nothingness. A nightmare born from deepest fears, coming to me unguarded. Whispering images unlocked from time and distance. A soul unbound - touched by others but never held. On a course charted by some unseen hand. The journey ahead promising no more than my past reflecting back upon me. Until at last, I reach the end. Facing a truth I can no longer deny. Alone, as ever.",72
MULDER,"Excuse me, I'm looking for the special needs ward.",9
WOMAN,Second door over there.,4
MULDER,Thanks.,1
SCULLY,"Emily? I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. His name is Mulder. Remember, I told you about him?",20
EMILY,Uh hum.,2
SCULLY,She's a little shy.,4
MULDER,What are you coloring?,4
EMILY,A potato.,2
MULDER,Have you ever seen Mr. Potato head? He looks like this. Doesn't it?,13
SCULLY,"I'll be right back. Thank you for coming. Something's wrong, isn't it?",12
MULDER,I found Emily's surrogate mother. I had Frohike hack into the California Social Services Adoption database.,16
SCULLY,You got a name?,4
MULDER,"Yeah, her mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi.",9
SCULLY,Fugazzi?,1
MULDER,"Yeah, as in slang term for fake.",7
SCULLY,I don't understand. Why create a false record?,8
MULDER,Because there are no true records. Emily didn't come into this world through any system that keeps them.,18
SCULLY,How did she come into this world?,7
MULDER,Have you asked yourself that?,5
SCULLY,"Well, she was born to someone, she... she has to belong to someone.",13
MULDER,"Someone, who's proven that they'll do anything to protect her or their interest in her.",15
SCULLY,I can protect her too.,5
MULDER,"Yeah, but who's going to protect you? Emily's adoptive parents are both dead, by no accident.",16
SCULLY,"I know... I've considered that, but I've also considered that there's only one right thing to do.",17
WOMAN,Emily?,1
MULDER,Why didn't you call me sooner?,6
SCULLY,Because I couldn't believe it. But I need you now to be a witness on my behalf in this hearing.,20
MULDER,And I should have declined... if I never want to see you hurt or harmed in any way.,18
SCULLY,Then why are you here?,5
MULDER,"Because I know something that I haven't said... Something that they'll use against you to jeopardize your custody of Emily. No matter how much you love this little girl, she's a miracle that was never meant to be, Scully.",39
BILL,They're ready for you.,4
MAN,"Agent Mulder, help me out here. Does FBI stand for Federal Bureau of Imagination? Am I to understand that your partner along with a dozen other woman in Allentown, PA, was abducted by employees of our federal government?",38
MULDER,"She was missing for 4 weeks, that's documented in the file.",11
MAN,"And you found evidence that during this time, she was subjected to experiments where... you say, they extracted her ova?",20
MULDER,"Yes, all of them.",4
MAN,Can this be done?,4
MULDER,"I believe it can, and was. That Emily Sim was conceived as a result of those experiments.",17
MAN,Can that be done as well?,6
MULDER,I don't know how else to explain it. A medical exam of Ms. Scully would show that she hasn't given birth.,21
MAN,"You know, under normal circumstances, this petition would be fairly simple. But I'm having difficulty wrapping my brain around this Michael Crichton bit.",23
MULDER,I included this information in anticipation of your reaction and how it might look if you received this information without any explanation.,22
MAN,"Can you give me an explanation? Why anyone would kidnap Ms. Scully, to conceive this child, then put it up for adoption?",22
MULDER,"No, but the fact remains, Ms. Scully is the mother of this child.",13
MAN,Not in any legal definition.,5
MULDER,"Well, if you can show me a legal precedent for this case, I'd like to see it. Dana has known for quite some time that she can't bear children. She doesn't know why, but however that happened, that fact that she can adopt this child, her own flesh and blood, is something I don't feel I have the right to question and I don't believe anyone has the right to stand in the way of.",75
SCULLY,It takes two of us just to get my sister-in-law into bed these days.,14
MULDER,When's she due?,3
SCULLY,"Two weeks ago. Why didn't you tell me, Mulder?",9
MULDER,I never expected this. I thought I was protecting you.,10
SCULLY,Why would they do this to me?,7
MULDER,"I only know that genetic experiments were being done, that children were being created.",14
SCULLY,Children being created for who?,5
MULDER,For who? For what? I don't know.,7
SCULLY,"Hello? Hello? Hello, is anybody there?",6
MULDER,I need to trace a call. I have an incoming call to residential line 555-0380.,15
SCULLY,"Mulder, it's...",2
MULDER,"Don't hang up. Okay, thanks. I got a trace. County Children's Center.",12
WOMAN,What is it? What's the matter?,6
MULDER,Anyone been here the last half hour?,7
WOMAN,No. What's going on?,4
SCULLY,She's burning up.,3
WOMAN,I'll call 911.,3
MULDER,Scully? There's something on her neck.,6
SCULLY,"Oh, my God.",3
MULDER,"All right, I'll try back later. I spoke to the social worker. She hasn't been able to reach Emily's doctor.",20
DOCTOR,Hi.,1
SCULLY,How is she?,3
DOCTOR,"Well, we've put her on a saline drip to rehydrate her. She's running a fever of about 102. It's a good thing you got her here when you did.",29
SCULLY,Do you know what's causing it?,6
DOCTOR,"Some kind of infection, probably related to the cyst on her neck.",12
MULDER,Do you know what that is?,6
DOCTOR,"No. I'm having it byopsied. I'll get it off to the lab right away. Now, are you two the parents?",20
SCULLY,I'm her mother.,3
DOCTOR,"Oh, okay. Can you give me any history that might help?",11
SCULLY,I know that she was being treated for anemia.,9
DOCTOR,You know what type?,4
SCULLY,I was told that it was some kind of auto immune hemolytic anemia. Her treatment was experimental.,17
DOCTOR,Who's her doctor?,3
SCULLY,His name is Calderon.,4
DOCTOR,I don't know him.,4
FEMALE DOCTOR,"I'm just going to roll you onto your side, Sweetie.",10
MULDER,Wait! Stop! Move away from her! Get away from her!,10
MULDER,She still sleeping?,3
SCULLY,They have her under a mild sedative.,7
MULDER,The ER doctor is in and out of consciousness.,9
SCULLY,How did you know?,4
MULDER,"If Emily was someone's creation, then it occurred to me that she might share the same body chemistry that we've seen before. So I had them put the ER doctor in a cooling bath like you did when I was exposed to this.",43
SCULLY,"So what now? She's still just a little girl. You say I can't protect her, but I can't let this be her life. Just a few days ago she was fine.",31
MULDER,She was also being treated.,5
DOCTOR,"Um, I just need some advice. With everything that's happening here, I'm a little at sea. This Dr. Calderon you say is Emily's physician? He's refusing to transfer her medical records.",31
SCULLY,He can't do that. He's endangering her life.,8
DOCTOR,"He said Emily was in his care, and if you're the one who's stopping that, then you're the one endangering her.",21
SCULLY,It's an ethical violation .,4
DOCTOR,He said she was part of a double blind medical trial and that he's spoken to you about it. He also says you have no authority over this child.,29
SCULLY,"Well, authority or not, I'm not leaving her side.",9
DOCTOR,"It's beyond me, I'm afraid.",5
MULDER,"Yeah, but it's not beyond Dr. Calderon.",7
CALDERON,"I'd like to say right up front that I know Emily Sim as your partner probably told you. My god, I... never met a sweeter, courageous little girl. I'm so sorry to hear about her down turn. My hope is these custody matters can be resolved so she may resume her treatment here. I'm afraid I can't release any information that relates to our companies experimental drug trials.",68
MULDER,What can I say to convince you?,7
CALDERON,"It's really not about convincing me. This is something that I- well, we... simply cannot do. It's purely a business reality. It has to do with Transgen's exposure to litigation and of course, our need to protect our research which frankly, represents a significant dollar investment.",46
MULDER,"So, I'm wasting your time. This isn't worth the life of a three year old girl.",16
CALDERON,"I wouldn't frame it like that. That's not it at all. Look, I'm truly sorry but there's really nothing I can do. However, I do wish you the very best.",30
MULDER,"Okay then. How do you feel now? Why don't you tell me what your company's really in the business of. Huh? Abducting women and stealing their unborn children? Medical rapists! That's all you are! You don't care if that little girl dies! She's just a lab rat to you! Tell me, whose life is worth saving, yours or hers? I want everything to help that little girl! I'll be back.",70
NURSE,We're ready.,2
SCULLY,Can you give me a minute with her? Hey... Sweetie? In a minute a nurse is going to take you down to have some tests.,25
EMILY,Mommy said no more tests.,5
SCULLY,We just want you to get better. That's what these tests are for.,13
CALDERON,He came to see me. He knows I'm involved.,9
MAN,Now you brought him to see us.,7
CALDERON,What do you want me to tell him?,8
MAN,Nothing.,1
SCULLY,I hope you know what this is.,7
DOCTOR,"An autoplastic mass, tumorous infection... The cyst on the back of Emily's neck seems to be the point of origin. And from her blood test last night and early this morning, it seems to be growing rapidly.",37
SCULLY,Is it cancer?,3
DOCTOR,"No. Cancer grows out of control. These are anaerobic channels following the path of the nervous system. They have the effect of killing surrounding tissue, depriving it of the oxygen it needs to survive. The origin is in the brain and central nervous system. It couldn't be in a worst place.",51
SCULLY,Can you put her on antivirals?,6
DOCTOR,I have her on a levophod drip to keep her blood pressure up and I've got her on steroids intravenously to bring down the inflammation. We could try radiation therapy.,30
SCULLY,"No, you can't do that. Her immune system's too weak.",10
WOMAN,What can you do? Has anyone talked to Dr. Calderon about this?,12
SCULLY,Dr. Calderon? Get Dr. Vinet in there and call the police. Dr. Calderon? Halt! Dr. Calderon! FBI! Stop that man!,20
MULDER,Yeah.,1
MULDER,I'm following Dr. Calderon.,4
SCULLY,"What do you mean, you've been following him. I just saw him. There was a scare here. He was here, he came into Emily's room. It appears he injected her with something.",32
MULDER,Is she all right?,4
SCULLY,"She seems to be, but we're running a tox screen anyway.",11
MULDER,Whatever he injected her with I don't think he meant to harm her.,13
SCULLY,What are you talking about?,5
MULDER,I think Dr. Calderon went there to treat her.,9
SCULLY,"Mulder, that doesn't make any sense. Why would he endanger her before only to protect her now?",17
MULDER,"As a bluff. I don't think they want her dead either, Scully, but for different reasons. Look, I'm going to catch up with you, all right?",26
SCULLY,Detective.,1
KRESGE,Happy New Year.,3
SCULLY,Thanks for coming down.,4
KRESGE,I'm posting two cops outside her room.,7
SCULLY,That might not be necessary.,5
KRESGE,What if this guy Calderon is thinking of coming back?,10
SCULLY,There seems to be some indication that he came here to help her.,13
KRESGE,I don't understand. You said on the phone that he was somehow connected to the deaths of Emily's parents...,19
SCULLY,"Because Emily's mother wanted to stop the tests, just like I did, and I guess that's why he came here because as much as they want to remove anything that gets in their way, it seems they need Emily to continue the tests.",43
ANNA,Hello?,1
MULDER,Anna Fugazzi?,2
ANNA,Yes?,1
MULDER,Your name is Anna Fugazzi?,5
ANNA,Yes. Are you the new doctor?,6
MULDER,"No, I'm not. Is that your real name?",8
ANNA,"Yes, for the last 71 years. Were you looking for me?",11
MULDER,Not until now.,3
SCULLY,I don't understand. Just an hour ago you said she was getting better.,13
DOCTOR,"That's right. Her fever's down, her vital signs are nearly back to normal. But these MRIs are telling me that this growth has continued to spread. What we're now seeing seems like a necratizing of the tissue.",37
SCULLY,It's killing her.,3
DOCTOR,"Whatever it is, it may already be present in some amount. Basically, it shut down her body while it continued to grow.",22
CHAMBLISS,I presented all this information to the court. I have to tell you that they are greatly concerned that you are making decisions for this child. And they seem to be having no small effect on her health.,38
SCULLY,"Ms. Chambliss, I am a medical doctor. And the decisions that I make are reasonable and right.",17
CHAMBLISS,But I have it right here in this report that Dr. Calderon's treatment of her actually resulted in a turnaround.,20
SCULLY,No. That is not true. The injection that Dr. Calderon gave her is actually making her worse.,17
CHAMBLISS,"I want to say something to you and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I don't think that you are capable right now of responding with any clinical ability.",34
SCULLY,Do you think I don't want what's best for this child? Do you think that I'm not trying to save her life?,22
CHAMBLISS,"I'm saying I'm getting wildly differing reports. I have a job to do. I'm not the ultimate authority here, but you don't have the authority, either over this child or her future.",32
SCULLY,"You can get a court order and you can try to enforce it, but I suggest that if you're going to do what's best for this child, then you do everything in your power to tell the authorities that if they take Emily out of this hospital, they are going to hasten her illness. And I'll let it be known that all of you are responsible.",66
CHAMBLISS,What do you want me to tell them you're doing for her?,12
SCULLY,"I don't know yet, but I will.",7
FROHIKE,"Christina Sherman. Delivered a healthy baby girl September 25, 1994. Delivered a baby boy March 18, 1986.",17
MULDER,Evelyn Burmeister.,2
FROHIKE,"Evelyn Burmeister... delivered a baby boy June 1, 1994.",9
MULDER,That makes 8 for 8.,5
FROHIKE,"Are you at Adoption Services, Mulder?",6
MULDER,No I'm at the maternity ward.,6
FROHIKE,Any fetching young mothers there?,5
MULDER,I think you might have a shot here Frohike. Do you know anything about pharmaceuticals?,15
FROHIKE,Medicinal or... recreational?,3
MULDER,There's two prescriptions on their med charts that all these women have in common. Abbreviated PMZ 200 and Duratab.,19
FROHIKE,Estrogen and pretesterone.,3
MULDER,Hormones.,1
FROHIKE,"But that doesn't make any sense, Mulder. Pregnant women have those hormones in abundance. You wouldn't give those to pregnant women.",21
MULDER,You would these. Anna? There's a doctor that comes to visit you. a Dr. Calderon.,15
ANNA,Yes. Do you know where he is?,7
MULDER,"No, actually, I'm looking for him.",6
ANNA,He was supposed to be here. I was going to start my beauty sleep.,14
MULDER,Your beauty sleep. What is that?,6
ANNA,He says it's taken years off my appearance.,8
SCULLY,"You okay in there, Emily. Good. I'm going to be right here the whole time, okay? Now we're just going to put some extra air in there, so you tell me if your ears start to hurt. You okay, Sweetie? Turn it off! Turn it off, NOW!",47
TECH,I'm doing it ma'am.,4
SCULLY,Hold on Sweetie. Settle down. We'll get you out of there as fact as we can.,16
KRESGE,Flinch and you're dead. Hands where I can see them. What you got there? Give it to me slowly. Hands against the wall. Spread your legs.,26
MULDER,Who are you?,3
KRESGE,"Detective Kresge, San Diego PD.",5
MULDER,"Detective Kresge, I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. Take the gun off me and put it on that man.",20
KRESGE,Stop right there!,3
MULDER,Run. Get out of here. Don't use your gun. Get out of here!,13
KRESGE,I said stop right there!,5
MULDER,Kresge...,1
KRESGE,I said stop right there!,5
MULDER,"Don't fire, Kresge!",3
MULDER,I'm an FBI agent. I have an emergency situation. I need an ambulance and I need backup.,17
ON PHONE,Where are you?,3
MULDER,I don't know where I am.,6
KRESGE,I have him inside.,4
MULDER,You have your weapon.,4
KRESGE,"I have him on the floor, hands cuffed.",8
MULDER,I have back up coming. I need a location though.,10
KRESGE,I'll take care of it. Just watch the guy.,9
MULDER,Detective Kresge is going to radio in the location.,9
SCULLY,"She's gone into a coma. I'm okay, Mulder. It's what's meant to be.",13
MULDER,But if you could treat her...,6
SCULLY,I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it to her.,8
MULDER,Are you sure?,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, whoever brought this child into this world... didn't intend to love her.",13
MULDER,I think she was born to... serve an agenda.,9
SCULLY,I have a chance to stop that. You were right. This child... was not meant to be.,17
MULDER,All right. I'll stay with you.,6
SCULLY,I think I'd like to be alone.,7
MRS. SCULLY,You ready?,2
SCULLY,"I think I'll ride back with Mulder. Bye, bye Matthew.",10
TARA,"We'll see you at home, okay?",6
SCULLY,Who are the men who would create a life whose only hope was to die?,15
MULDER,I don't know. But the fact that you found her... and had a chance to love her... Then maybe she was meant for that too.,25
SCULLY,She found me.,3
MULDER,So you could save her.,5
SCULLY,How's Detective Kresge?,3
MULDER,He's doing better. He's already out of the ICU.,9
SCULLY,And the men who did this to him?,8
MULDER,They've already cleaned up the nursing home. All the women have been placed in new homes. There's no evidence that anyone at Transgen Corporation knew of Calderon's work.,28
SCULLY,There is evidence of what they did.,7
