COPS ANNOUNCER,Cops is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.,25
WETZEL,"I don't know what it is about a full moon. It's just something about it. People just go off the wall. I mean, these are some pretty scary neighborhoods to begin with.",32
WETZEL,"I haven't been on the job that long myself but I've seen more than my fair share of crazy stuff. When the moon is full, it's just like times ten. I don't know, uh... I don't know. Maybe it's the tides or something. But irregardless, we're on the job and if that makes people breathe a little easier knowing we're out there. Be a little less nervous walking the streets at night, well, that's, that's a good feeling. PROWLER CALL",80
WETZEL,"Okay, we got a report of somebody lurking around the neighborhood making noise. Actually, I take that back. We got a report of a... ""monster"" lurking around the neighborhood? What the...? Hey, it's a full moon. A lot of drug activity in this district. We're probably looking at somebody rattling doorknobs trying to steal some money for a quick fix. Usually they're not the stealthiest of criminals so maybe we'll get lucky and sneak up on 'em.",77
WETZEL,2-12 Adam is 10-97.,4
DISPATCH,2-12 Adam is 10-97 at 543 local.,7
WETZEL,2-12 Adam to dispatch. I don't see anything. Can you let the lady inside her house know I'm out here?,20
DISPATCH,"2-12 Adam, copy your request. Calling now.",7
WETZEL,Think he was doing it? Psst!,6
WETZEL,A lot of scratches. Maybe a big dog. That's probably what she saw.,13
WETZEL,Sheriff's Department.,2
MRS. GUERRERO,Is a claw monster! Mira... Matenlo! Matenlo!,7
WETZEL,Calmate! No monstruo...,3
MRS. GUERRERO,It's a monster!,3

MRS. GUERRERO,Buscalo!,1
WETZEL,"Man, scared of something.",4
WETZEL,"Hey, you there! You! Freeze! Sheriff's department! Freeze! Sheriff's department!",10
WETZEL,"Run, run! To the car! Back to the car now! Now! Run! Run, *bleep* damn it, run!",17
CAMERAMAN,Ow!,1
WETZEL,"Now, now! Come on! Get up! Get up! Back to the car! Come on! Run, run! Get in the car! Get in the car!",24
CAMERAMAN,Holy !,1
WETZEL,Come on!,2
WETZEL,"10-33, 10-33, 2-12 Adam needs assistance...",6
WETZEL,I need assistance at the 500 block of Vogel! I need assistance! Ah! 999! 999... 9...!,16
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Everybody all right? Hey, you all right? You all right? *Bleep*, Keith. What was this?",15
WETZEL,"I was responding to a 921 at this house right here and... there was a prowler call and, uh...",19
SERGEANT DUTHIE,You flipped it?,3
WETZEL,"No, no. Hell, no, I didn't flip it. It was... We were parked. The... we were attacked.",17
SERGEANT DUTHIE,By who? By gangbangers?,4
WETZEL,Uh...,1
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Keith?,1
WETZEL,"Yeah, I mean yeah, it was gangbangers.",7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Okay, fan out and search.",5
WETZEL,"Hey, Sarge, you better double everybody up.",7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Hold on a minute. Everybody double up. Set me up a command post and check on that airship. How many?,20
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Keith, Keith?",2
WETZEL,"You know, I didn't get a good look. Maybe...",9
DISPATCH,"417, suspects on foot just one block north of Holly!",10
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Armed suspects! Bring some units around on Holly Street!,9
OFFICER,Get your hands up!,4
SCULLY,FBI!,1
OFFICER,I don't care! Get your hands up!,7
MULDER,FBI!,1
OFFICER,Turn around! Turn around!,4
MULDER,I got I.D. In my back pocket.,7
SCULLY,We're investigating a case!,4
MULDER,Check the I.D.!,3
OFFICERS,Behind your head!,3
MULDER,Check my I.D. in the back pocket.,7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Hold it, they're FBI! Give 'em back their guns!",9
MULDER,Thank you.,2
SCULLY,We're investigating a case.,4
SERGEANT DUTHIE,What case?,2
MULDER,Same case you're working on.,5
SERGEANT DUTHIE,So who we looking for?,5
MULDER,"Not who, what.",3
SCULLY,"Mulder, what the hell is going on here?",8
MULDER,I don't know.,3
SERGEANT DUTHIE,You okay?,2
MULDER,See the claw marks here? Someone tried to get in.,10
MULDER,"Deputy? Deputy, can you describe for me what you saw?",10
WETZEL,"Um, I mean, it was pretty dark. Umm. I didn't really see. I don't know. I don't know.",18
MULDER,"Well, you must have seen something in order to run away from it, huh? You were responding to the same call we were-- of a monster prowling the neighborhood.",29
SERGEANT DUTHIE,We've been to this house before. The lady has a history of medication. Know what I mean?,17
MULDER,"Yeah, maybe, but she's not the only one seeing monsters. There's been half a dozen such sightings in this area in the past 60 days. Were you aware of that?",30
WETZEL,No. I mean...,3
MULDER,"Yeah. Also, these sightings only occur on nights when there's a full moon which tells me something.",17
SERGEANT DUTHIE,What?,1
MULDER,"What you saw was large, right? Maybe seven, eight feet tall when it stood up on its two legs? And it was covered in fur and had glowing red eyes and claws...",32
MULDER,Claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door.,11
SERGEANT DUTHIE,You're not serious.,3
MULDER,"And dare I forget teeth. It bit you, didn't it? Look at that. Deputy, how long were you going to hide that from the E.M.T.S?",25
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Where did you get that, Keith?",6
WETZEL,I don't even know where that came from.,8
WETZEL,"I mean, I didn't see anything that he's talking about.",10
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Big teeth, eight feet tall? What the hell are you describing?",11
MULDER,A werewolf.,2
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Excuse me?,2
MULDER,It's what did that. It also attacked one Hyman Escalara 29 days ago during the last full moon. Hyman died of his wounds in Compton General Hospital but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him. My partner and I are here to catch it.,47
MULDER,"Unfortunately though, Deputy, you've been bitten. The skin is broken. Werewolf lore pretty much universally holds that someone who's been bitten by such a creature is going to become such a creature himself, so...",34
WETZEL,"Wait a minute. I mean, that's not what really happened, though.",11
MULDER,"I'm sorry, but you're going to have to be isolated and kept under guard.",14
SERGEANT DUTHIE,With all due respect what the *bleep* are you talking about?,11
MULDER,I'm talking about preventing this man from becoming a danger to himself and to others.,15
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Can I see your badge again?,6
SCULLY,"Agent Mulder, can we have a word a second.",9
MULDER,Excuse me.,2
MULDER,What is it?,3
SCULLY,"""What is it""? Mulder, have you noticed that we're on television?",11
MULDER,"I don't think it's live television, Scully. She just said *bleep*.",11
SCULLY,But it's a camera and it's recording.,7
SCULLY,It's recording everything that you are saying. Do you understand that? I just want to make sure that you're clear on that.,22
MULDER,"I'm clear on that, Scully.",5
SCULLY,"My point being, Mulder, that we're on a case.",9
MULDER,"This presents an opportunity. I feel we're very close here. The possibility of capturing concrete proof of the paranormal? Of a werewolf in front of a national audience, even an international audience? What's not to love?",36
SCULLY,Wh...,1
SCULLY,"Look, Mulder, you want to talk about werewolves to me you can knock yourself out. I may not agree with you but at least I'm not going to hold it against you but this... Mulder, this could ruin your career.",40
MULDER,"What career? Scully, I appreciate it. You don't want me looking foolish. I do. I appreciate that.",17
SCULLY,"I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.",7
MULDER,"Okay, fine. Well, do me a favor. Will you escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital? Just keep an eye on him in case I'm right? Thank you.",27
SCULLY,"I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.",5
MULDER,Okay.,1
SCULLY,I'm sure he's going to want to say a couple of words about this.,14
SCULLY,"Guys, give it a rest, huh?",6
MRS. GUERRERO,"Por favor, me tiene que creer. Lo vi con mis propios ojos. Mire, paso por ahi. Yo lo vi. Paso por ahi, por la ventana. Lo vi por la ventana de mi cocina. Deputy Juan Molina",36
MRS. GUERRERO,"Por favor, hagan algo.",4
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,Calmese.,1
MRS. GUERRERO,"No me digan que me calme. Hagan algo, por favor",10
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"She says... I guess she's calling it a ""claw monster""... was trying to break into the house and get her. It was big and had claws pretty much. She's going on and on.",33
MULDER,"Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist. Will you work with her?",19
RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST,"""Claw monster""?",2
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Just do it, Ricky.",4
RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST,Okay.,1
MULDER,"Look at that. Excuse me. Look at this. It's like five claw marks. Just like the human hand has five fingers. Pretty much the same spread, too.",27
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Agent, you seriously believe we're looking for some kind of a...?",11
MULDER,I'll show you. This... this is what Hyman Escalara described just before succumbing to his injuries.,16
MULDER,"Ten to one that's what Mrs. Guerrero's going to describe, too.",11
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,Sir? Sir? We got your suspect.,6
MRS. GUERRERO,Claw monster. Claw monster.,4
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"Claw monster. Boy, you know, they kill him in every movie and he just keeps coming back. I'm sorry.",19
MULDER,This is strange.,3
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Gracias, Mrs. Guerrero. We're looking for gangbangers.",7
RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST,"You don't think it's some guy dressed up like Freddy Krueger, do you?",13
RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST,Can somebody walk me to my car? It's dark out and I'm parked up the street.,16
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"Come on, Ricky, I'll walk you to your car.",9
RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST,Can I return this vest later?,6
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"Yeah, you can return the vest later, Ricky.",8
MULDER,This is what she was seeing?,6
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"That's what she's saying. That's the claw monster, man.",9
MRS. GUERRERO,You catch?,2
MULDER,Catch him?,2
MRS. GUERRERO,"Si, si. You catch.",4
MULDER,How's Deputy Wetzel?,3
MULDER,You let him get released?,5
SCULLY,"Well... those weren't teeth marks, Mulder. They turned out to be insect bites...",13
MULDER,Oh.,1
SCULLY,"Individual welts or stings of some sort. Together, they just looked like a larger pattern especially when we want them to...... although it was an understandable conclusion that I'm sure anybody would have made.",34
MULDER,"So, what did Skinner say?",5
SCULLY,He said that the FBI has nothing to hide... and neither do we.,13
MULDER,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Scully, I'm not entirely convinced that we're looking for a werewolf anymore.",20
SCULLY,"Oh. All right, good.",4
MULDER,"No, something else. I'm not sure what. Some other kind of creature, though. That I'm sure of.",17
MULDER,"Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? OFFICER; Six blocks from here-- could be what we're looking for.",17
DISPATCH,800 block of Belmont.,4
SCULLY,No. You go with someone else.,6
DISPATCH,"We have a 9-29, man down on the corner of Belmont and Fisher. PERSON DOWN",15
SCULLY,"Guys, watch out. I'm a doctor.",6
DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA,"Oh, man, it's Ricky.",4
MULDER,"That's what I was afraid of, Scully.",7
WETZEL,"Well, when a fellow officer goes down in the line of duty or even if this... or even if it's not a fellow officer-- if it's just somebody working part-time with the department in a, uh, support, um... a-arti-artistic capacity, uh, like R... like Ricky, there-- we all feel it. Uh... Back there is every cop's worst nightmare... But that's when you got to cowboy up and give 150%... catch the bad guys.",73
SCULLY,Last call from this phone was made to the Road Club-- Ricky Koehler requesting roadside assistance for his flat tire. He asked them to hurry. He said he didn't feel safe.,31
SCULLY,What's that?,2
MULDER,"Our suspect, apparently.",3
MULDER,"Slash marks match up pretty well, wouldn't you say?",9
SCULLY,Somebody lost a nail.,4
MULDER,Nice color.,2
SCULLY,"Check out this color, Mulder-- blood red.",7
MULDER,"Hey, uh... who called 911 on this?",7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Hey, Steve and Edy-- Sergeant Paula.",6
MULDER,*The* Steve and Edy?,4
SERGEANT DUTHIE,They're good folks. They usually call us if there's trouble in the neighborhood.,13
STEVE,Ooh...,1
EDY,"Oh, my God, look at this. Look at all these people, Lord.",12
SERGEANT DUTHIE,How are you two doing this evening?,7
STEVE,"Uh, uh, we're fine.",4
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Can y'all tell us what happened out here this evening?,10
EDY,"Not with me looking like this, mm-mmm. Now, you should know better than that, Sergeant Paula.",16
STEVE,Like she going to run from a camera. Lookit here... we heard all this screaming. Peeked out the window and this boy with crazy hair was having a conniption fit all rolled up there by the phone.,37
SCULLY,You didn't see his-his attacker?,5
STEVE,Mmm... Mm-mmm.,2
EDY,I'm ready for my close-up.,5
STEVE,"Oh, ain't nobody care about your scabby ass. This is police business. Now, I didn't see... What you say-- ""attacker""? No, he was just kind of all rolled up and yelling.",31
EDY,Mm-hmm. Mmm .,2
MULDER,Did you see anything... that looked like this?,8
STEVE,"Ooh, stop.",2
MULDER,Or this?,2
STEVE,"Ooh, excuse me?",3
EDY,That's going to give me nightmares.,6
SCULLY,"So, you didn't see anything at all?",7
EDY,"Mm-mmm, no, mm-mmm.",3
SCULLY,"Did you, uh, did you see a woman?",8
EDY,Mmm... M...,2
BOTH,Mm-hmm.,1
EDY,Chantara. I know that skanky-ass color anywhere.,7
STEVE,Sure do. Chantara.,3
EDY,Mm-hmm.,1
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Chantara the streetwalker?,3
EDY,Mm-hmm.,1
STEVE,She work the corner.,4
EDY,Mm-hmm.,1
STEVE,She on the pipe...,4
EDY,"Oh, yeah.",2
STEVE,"So, we don't associate, you know what I'm saying?",9
EDY,"Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, no.",3
MULDER,"Well-well, we should may... we should go tal... we'll go talk to Chantara, then.",14
STEVE,"Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Mm-hmm.",10
EDY,"Hey, hey... When am I going to get my own TV show? If I didn't care...",16
STEVE,"Oh, she's showing off now.",5
EDY,... more than words can say,5
STEVE,Stop. Get in the house. Stop. Get back.,8
EDY,If I didn't care,4
STEVE,Would you excuse us? Excuse... Stop it.,7
EDY,Would I feel this way?,5
STEVE,"Bye, y'all. Bye.",3
MULDER,"So, apparently, we're on the lookout for someone whose hair matches her fingernails-- bubblegum pink. That'd be a good color for you, Scully.",23
MULDER,"I'd have to say that at, uh, this point in the investigation I'm-I'm usually a little more secure in-in what it is we're actually investigating but we've had so many conflicting eyewitness reports that it's-it's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we're looking for... But the crimes we are investigating are-are paranormal. Uh, I can say that... with absolute conviction um, an-and the nature of these crimes they're-they're-they're notoriously hard to quantify on any kind of regular scientific level as Agent Scully will tell you.",86
SCULLY,"Oh, yeah.",2
MULDER,"Yeah, which-which in it... in it... in its own way i-is a... is a kind of a validation if you think about it, in and of itself, uh, but-but, you know, that's-that's our job. That's why they pay us the big bucks.",42
SCULLY,Bubblegum pink.,2
SCULLY,Don't run! FBI.,3
MULDER,Chantara Gomez? Chantara Gomez.,4
SCULLY,FBI. Chantara! Go...,3
SCULLY,Don't run. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.,9
MULDER,Chantara Gomez?,2
SCULLY,Can I see your hands please?,6
CHANTARA GOMEZ,I didn't do nothing!,4
SCULLY,"May I see your hands, please? It's okay. Let me see your hands, please.",14
MULDER,Show her your hands.,4
SCULLY,"Earlier this evening, a man was attacked. He was badly slashed and you realize this places you at the crime scene.",21
MULDER,"Fisher and Belmont-- that's your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?",10
CHANTARA GOMEZ,"Look, I heard screaming, okay? And I went and I tried to help this guy and when I heard the sirens, I just ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!",30
MULDER,"All right, look, I believe you. I think you saw something. You witnessed something. Tell me what it is.",19
CHANTARA GOMEZ,I can't.,2
SCULLY,"You can tell us, Chantara.",5
SCULLY,"Come on, Chantara.",3
MULDER,"Chantara... if you're afraid that what you tell us we're not going to believe it, don't be 'cause whatever it is you saw tonight... whatever it is, whatever you think you saw however strange or terrifying or bizarre, you are not going to surprise me, okay?",46
CHANTARA GOMEZ,You'll protect me from Chuco?,5
MULDER,Who's Chuco?,2
CHANTARA GOMEZ,"Mi novio. He's the one who cut that guy up, not me! I didn't do anything!",16
MULDER,"I'm s... I'm sorry, what?",5
SCULLY,"""Mi novio""-- her boyfriend.",4
MULDER,"No, no, I-I got that.",5
CHANTARA GOMEZ,"Look, he's been chasing me for a week, okay? He said he was going to twist my neck off like a little chicken if I didn't give him more money.",30
MULDER,Chuco.,1
CHANTARA GOMEZ,Chuco Munoz-- the cops know who he is.,8
OFFICER,This is my favorite part of the job-- knocking down crack houses.,12
WETZEL,I heard that.,3
CHANTARA GOMEZ,I don't understand. I told you everything. Why can't I just go now?,13
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Chantara. Chantara! First of all, you are not out of the woods yet...",13
CHANTARA GOMEZ,I just want to go home.,6
SERGEANT DUTHIE,... as far as possible accessory charges.,6
CHANTARA GOMEZ,Chuco's the one you want.,5
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"So, the sooner we find him and sort this out the sooner, I hope, we can let you go.",19
CHANTARA GOMEZ,He's going to kill me! He told me he was going to twist my neck off like a chicken.,19
SCULLY,"Chantara, no one's going to kill you.",7
CHANTARA GOMEZ,He's going to kill me!,5
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Chantara, look ar... look around you! You see all the deputies here? You see? No one is going to get you. Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here is going to keep an eye on you while we go and put the cuffs on Chuco. No one is going to get you.",51
CHANTARA GOMEZ,Shoot.,1
DISPATCH,"76. Roger. 9-1-1 Davidson, 0-9-9-6, checking N.C.I.C.",7
SCULLY,"Chuco Munoz, the man himself. Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull.",14
MULDER,He's not our guy.,4
SCULLY,What do you mean?,4
MULDER,"I don't care how bad his rep is, he can't turn over a squad car.",15
SCULLY,"Yeah, well, maybe not by himself but he's probably got friends, right?",12
MULDER,"No, there's something else going on.",6
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Let's hit it.,3
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Go, go, go! Go, go! Hands above your head! Put your hands above your head! Go, go, go!",18
OFFICER1,"Have you seen Chuco Munoz? ANGRY CRACKHEAD; *Bleep* you, mother-*long bleep*!",11
OFFICER 2,Move it! Move it!,4
OFFICER 3,Where are they? Put your hands where I can see them. Where I can see them.,16
CALM CRACKHEAD,Take your *bleep* hands off me!,6
DISPATCH,"2-13 Lincoln, we are...",4
CALM CRACKHEAD,"Oh, man.",2
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Agents? Agents, in here.",4
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Hey, what happened, huh? Wake up. What happened to your friend in there?",13
MAN,What's going on?,3
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Looks like he O.D.'D.,4
MULDER,"Yeah, but how long ago?",5
SCULLY,"Couple of days, maybe a week. He didn't attack Ricky Koehler, that's for sure.",14
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Shots fired.,2
DISPATCH,"2-12 Adam, be advised that you're a 9-23.",8
OFFICER,There!,1
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"What? What? What? What you got? What you shooting at? What are you shooting at?! Keith, what are you doing?!",20
WETZEL,It just came back. It was here.,7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Keith...,1
WETZEL,"It was... It was here. Oh, man. I heard her screaming and I-I-I tried to. I tried to stop it. I swear to you, I tried. I did everything I could do.",32
SERGEANT DUTHIE,"Oh, shoot.",2
WETZEL,I did everything I could do.,6
SCULLY,"What is it, Mulder? What? Oh.",6
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Call it in.,3
OFFICER,"2-12 boy, I have a possible 9-27.",7
SERGEANT DUTHIE,I wish someone would explain to me what the hell is going on here. It just doesn't make sense. Keith Wetzel may be a little green but he is a solid deputy-- a squared-away individual. Nothing could have gotten past him and killed that woman.,45
OFFICER,There's no sign of what he was shooting at. This was all we found. Nine millimeter. It's our issue.,19
SCULLY,Where'd you find that?,4
OFFICER,It was lying in the middle of the street. Doesn't look like a ricochet.,14
MULDER,Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at. Excuse me.,10
MULDER,"Hey, Deputy. You ready to talk to me now? You and I both know you saw something. We're way past claiming you didn't.",23
WETZEL,I only know what I thought I saw.,8
MULDER,"Well, describe it for me.",5
WETZEL,The wasp man.,3
MULDER,The wasp man?,3
WETZEL,It's ridicu... It's ridiculous. The scary stories my older brother used to tell me when I was a kid about a monster with a head like a wasp and a mouthful of stingers instead of teeth. He said that it would come get me in my sleep and that... and that it would sting me to death.,57
MULDER,"So you're saying that the, uh, the wasp man attacked you both times here, and earlier in the patrol car?",20
WETZEL,"I - I'm not saying that that's what it was, okay? I mean... they didn't see it. It's not on the videotape. This... this can't be real.",26
MULDER,I think maybe it can. Just... just relax a minute. Excuse me. Scully?,13
MULDER,"We came on this case looking for a werewolf, right?",10
SCULLY,"Well, you did, that's correct.",5
MULDER,"Hyman Escalara claimed he was attacked by a werewolf and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out, right? And then, Wetzel over here sees a wasp man with stingers for teeth and he gets a bite mark that you say is irrefutably insect-like, right?",48
SCULLY,"Mulder, that's not exactly...",4
MULDER,"And then another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger. Scully, what if we're dealing with one creature, one entity that, when it attacks, appears to you as your worst nightmare? Fear. Maybe that's what this thing feeds on.",38
SCULLY,"Okay, well, for the sake of this argument...",8
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,...How would one catch something like that?,7
MULDER,"Probably by... by figuring out how it chooses its prey. I mean, there... It seems to spread like a contagion, doesn't it? One person's fear becomes the next. There's a definite chain of victims. Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist and then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez and then...",57
SCULLY,Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.,5
MULDER,Right.,1
SCULLY,"But you're missing someone, Mulder.",5
MULDER,Who?,1
SCULLY,"Edy. Steve and Edy. They're a part of this chain, too and, and according to your theory they would have been attacked, right?",23
MULDER,"Well, we're back at the home of Steve and Edy. Thought we'd check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile.",23
SCULLY,I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?,7
STEVE,...What the hell is this?! What the hell is this?!,10
SCULLY,"Steve, are you going to be all right?",8
STEVE,I'm all right.,3
EDY,Somebody ask me if I'm all right. I'm the victim. I'm the victim here. He don't treat me right. You'd better appreciate me or I'll walk out that door.,29
STEVE,The hell you would.,4
MULDER,We're not here to get involved in any kind of personal...,11
EDY,He treats my mama with disrespect. He treats me with disrespect.,11
STEVE,"Oh, shut up!",3
MULDER,We're not here to get involved in personal problems.,9
EDY,"You-- you, shut up.",4
MULDER,Settle down.,2
EDY,He won't make love to me!,6
MULDER,Oh. Uh...,2
STEVE,I should have never touched you!,6
EDY,"Oh, no! No...",3
SCULLY,"Look, you guys, Steve, Edy. The reason why we are here is because we are concerned about your safety. We're concerned about your lives. You witnessed a violent attack right across the street from your house.",36
STEVE,So you say. I just saw a rolled up boy with crazy hair.,13
MULDER,"Well, take our word for it. Because of your proximity to the attack we think you may be targeted as well.",21
EDY,Why? Because we called the police?,6
MULDER,"No, no. That's not why. That's not why. I can't really explain it exactly, but it's... I think the key is to remain unemotional, okay? Try to stay calm. Try to keep your heart rate down. Try to keep your adrenaline down. Just try to relax. Just... Oh, you got it. You got it.",54
STEVE,Good luck!,2
EDY,"Oh, you!",2
MULDER,I think maybe we should stay up for a little while. Let's just... let's just re-lax.,16
MULDER,Just relax.,2
STEVE,Mr. Mulder? Look here. I got to go to bed.,10
MULDER,"How you doing, Edy? You still upset?",7
EDY,I'm scared.,2
MULDER,You're scared?,2
EDY,I'm scared he gonna leave me.,6
STEVE,"No, no, no, no.",4
SCULLY,Think we should take them to a motel?,8
STEVE,We don't need no hotel. We've been living in this house for 17 years. Ain't nobody going to chase us out.,21
EDY,Mm-mm.,1
MULDER,You're not afraid?,3
STEVE,"Now, I didn't say that. I said, ain't nobody going to chase us out.",14
EDY,Mm-mm.,1
SCULLY,"Oh, God. More of you?",5
WETZEL,We any closer to an arrest?,6
SCULLY,"I'm afraid not. Mulder, what next?",6
MULDER,"Well, I'd say we should station a couple of deputies out here but I don't think it's coming back here. We're just playing catch-up with this thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect. And, uh, well, we've got four or five hours till the moon sets. The attacks only occur on the full moon then we're out of luck.",59
SCULLY,"Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.",7
MULDER,For a possible contagion?,4
SCULLY,"Your ""contagion of fear""?",4
MULDER,Yeah.,1
SCULLY,No.,1
MULDER,No?,1
SCULLY,But if I can't figure out what this thing was at least I can figure out what it wasn't.,19
MULDER,All right. Make it fast. Fill that tank up with gas.,11
MULDER,"Uh, Deputy, you're the only person who's seen this twice so I'd like to ride with you, if you don't mind.",21
WETZEL,Let's go.,2
MULDER,Thanks.,1
WETZEL,"You really believe me, huh? You really believe I saw what I thought I saw?",15
MULDER,"Yeah, I believe you.",4
WETZEL,Why?,1
MULDER,Why do I believe you?,5
WETZEL,"Yeah. I mean, what proof do you have what I'm saying is real? I mean, it's not... it's not on the video tape.",23
MULDER,The camera doesn't always tell the whole story.,8
WETZEL,And what about your partner? Does she believe me?,9
MULDER,I don't think she thinks you're lying.,7
WETZEL,"Yeah, but what? Maybe I'm crazy? You know, I've been on the job 18 months-- all I ever wanted to do. Right out of the gate, I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy? I mean, you know how cops are. How's somebody supposed to live that down?",49
MULDER,"I don't know. Uh, I guess just do good work.",10
WETZEL,"It's a hard enough job already, you know? You want to help people but it's like the freaking Wild West out here. You know people hate you? Every shift, I go out thinking... Go ahead....I go out thinking, ""You know, there's somebody out there who wants to take me out. Am I going to run into him tonight?"" And it's hard to have a fast-track career in law enforcement when everybody thinks you're nuts.",74
MULDER,Tell me about it.,4
SCULLY,"Chantara Gomez, age 31, apparent cause of death is the fracturing of the second and third cervical vertebrae. There are contusions consistent with, uh, choking or throttling uh, by very powerful hands.",32
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"People are saying her pimp killed her from beyond the grave. That's the story going around. It's crazy, huh?",19
SCULLY,"Well, let's see if we can put that story to rest, shall we?",13
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"The other thing I heard was, uh... something about contagion? Like with this body?",14
SCULLY,"That's... that's completely inaccurate. This, uh, investigation is... is... We're moving towards an apparent chain of victims and I seriously doubt that we're going to find anything that looks like a contagious pathology here.",34
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"Because, I mean, if we were we should be taking precautions. If the body could be contagious, you... We're not even wearing masks.",23
SCULLY,"Look, this is obviously a murder, here. I mean, this woman died of a broken neck, right? Not the hantavirus.",20
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,Who said anything about the hantavirus?,6
SCULLY,"Nobody. I just... I was, um... It was a figure of speech.",12
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"It's just, the reason I asked is why is it so urgent",12
TO DO AN AUTOPSY AT 3,"00 in the morning? I mean, that kind of rush-- it's just unheard of.",14
SCULLY,We're trying to look for the killer.,7
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"Well, we got murder victims stacked three-deep in the freezer. Plus you got this camera crew reporting everything. Why?",19
SCULLY,Because the FBI has nothing to hide.,7
SCULLY,"Look, there is no ulterior motive here. It's just... Are you going to help me out here, or what?",19
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,Yeah. Of course.,3
SCULLY,Thank you.,2
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,Why did you mention the hantavirus?,6
SCULLY,"Look, I...",2
CORONER'S ASSISTANT,"Oh, my God.",3
SCULLY,Call 911. Call 911! 911!,5
SCULLY,Get out of here! Come on!,6
SCULLY,"It's not the hantavirus. It looks for all the world like the hantavirus but I can promise you that it's not. Well, I mean, she-she exhibited all the symptoms-- the hemorrhagic fever, the severe chills, acute shock. But, I mean, the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds. And the hantavirus doesn't kill that fast. I mean, no virus in the world kills that fast.",69
MULDER,You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died? Why?,11
SCULLY,"Because she kept bringing it up. I mean, it was like the power of suggestion, Mulder. She was-she was standing there. She was saying that she was afraid of contagion and then all of a sudden, she just...",38
MULDER,She was afraid. She was afraid... and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine.,20
SERGEANT DUTHIE,What do you mean by that?,6
MULDER,It's the same. It's the same M.O. Same as the others. What we've been looking for all night. This-this entity or force somehow vectored off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman.,32
SCULLY,"No, no, no, Mulder. I was standing right here. I didn't see anything. They didn't see anything.",17
MULDER,"Yeah, but you weren't afraid.",5
SCULLY,"The hell I wasn't afraid, Mulder. I don't know what's going on here.",13
MULDER,"You weren't afraid for your life. Neither were Steve to. This... this... this thing whatever it is, is attracted to that. Everybody who was attacked felt that intensely.",28
SERGEANT DUTHIE,For * beep* sakes.,3
MULDER,"No, no. It makes perfect sense. You said so. You asked me earlier what would this thing be doing in Willow Park. Well, where else would it go but a high-crime neighborhood? Somewhere where people live behind barred windows and are afraid to go out at night. Where's Deputy Wetzel?",50
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Back on patrol.,3
SCULLY,"Mulder, you were walking around with him for three hours and you didn't see anything...",15
MULDER,But I was with him. I was backing him up.,10
WETZEL,"Like I said, there's something about a full moon. Things definitely get strange. Well... we checked everyplace else tonight. Let's check this place again.",24
WETZEL,Ah... Come on. God * bleep* it!,6
WETZEL,"I'm calling for backup. Get out! Get out, now! Get out!",11
CAMERAMAN,Don't know how to!,4
WETZEL,Let's go! I got it! I got it! Hurry up! Come on! I can't open it!,16
CAMERAMAN,"Oh, God! God! *Bleep*",4
SERGEANT DUTHIE,There's Wetzel's car.,3
MULDER,Wetzel?!,1
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Get the battering ram.,4
MULDER,That gun's not going to be any good.,8
SCULLY,It's the battering ram.,4
MULDER,"Well, how come they're not in yet?",7
SCULLY,Wind?,1
MULDER,If you say so.,4
SCULLY,Damn it. I hate you guys.,6
MULDER,Where's Wetzel?,2
CAMERAMAN,We don't know. There's something out there.,7
MULDER,Stay where you are.,4
CAMERAMAN,* Bleep* yeah.,2
MULDER,"Look at this, Scully.",4
SCULLY,Deputy Wetzel?,2
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Agent Scully? You guys need assistance?,6
MULDER,Wetzel? Wetzel?,2
MULDER,Wetzel?,1
WETZEL,"My God, let go of me! Get off of me!",10
MULDER,Wetzel?!,1
WETZEL,"Please, help me!",3
MULDER,"Wetzel, don't be afraid. It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid! That's what it wants. Hello? Wetzel? It can't hurt you! You're a * bleep* Sheriff's Deputy, Wetzel! Don't be afraid now. And you're on national television, so cowboy up!",39
MULDER,Geez.,1
MULDER,Wetzel?,1
SCULLY,He's alive.,2
SERGEANT DUTHIE,Deputy Wetzel?,2
SCULLY,We're up here!,3
SERGEANT DUTHIE,*Beep* What happened?,3
MULDER,The sun just came up.,5
OFFICER,"Be strong. Hang in there, kid.",6
SCULLY,You think the Deputy stopped it whatever it was?,9
MULDER,Maybe it just went away until the next full moon. I don't know. You've got to figure there's enough fear in the world that if it doesn't show up in Willow Park it's going to show up someplace else.,39
SCULLY,"You didn't get the proof that you wanted, Mulder.",9
MULDER,"Well, hey, you know, it all depends on how they edit it together.",13
SCULLY,It's going to be a hard one to write up.,10
